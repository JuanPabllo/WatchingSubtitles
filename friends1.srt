How did you get through it?

170
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,392
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

171
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,144
- Say her...
- Leg?

Heh. That's one way of going through it,
yeah.

174
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,651
- You actually broke her watch?
- Mm.

175
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,363
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

176

You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

Anyway...

180
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:20,512
You know what's scary? What if
there's only one woman for everybody?

181
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:24,057
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

182
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:29,104
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

183

What are you talking about?
One woman.

184
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,028
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

185
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,949
Let me tell you something, Ross.
There's lots of flavors out there.

186
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,578
There's rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

187
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,709
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

188

want that fifth date?

Yeah, I do.

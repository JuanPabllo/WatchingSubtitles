1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,482
Okay... hole me.

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,719
- Mm!
- Nothin' but mouth.

3
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:08,121
- Whoa, impressive.
- Are you kidding me?

4
00:00:08,156 --> 00:00:09,679
That's uh-nothing.

5
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:11,324
Diaz has been chucking D-holes

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,093
into my mouth-piece since
we were back at the academy.

7
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:14,294
Check this out.

8
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:35,548
Oh!

9
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,250
- Oh!
- Uh-oh.

10
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:38,785
<i>Heads!</i>

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,786
What the...?

12
00:00:42,557 --> 00:00:45,058
It's finally happening!

13
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:03,027

00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:08,148
Attention, Nine-Nine.
We have an announcement.

15
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,235
"Shrek Live" is coming back to Broadway!

16
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,511
- Nope, you dreamed that.
- Aw.

17
00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:14,239
We just came in here
to tell you to save the date,

18
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,374
because we're getting
married on May 15th.

19
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,808
We found a venue!

20
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,777
Wow!

21
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,113
Finding a place in the spring
in New York is impossible.

22
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:24,082
Sharon and I had to get married
in Albany in December.

23
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,650
Terry was too cold to consummate.

24
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,519
- Hm, good to know.
- We got really lucky.

25
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,122
The place was booked solid for the
next two years, but a couple fell out.

26
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,556
Of a fifth-floor window.

27
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,458
She was teetering and
he tried to grab her...

28
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,060
Babe, we agreed we wouldn't
talk about that part.

29
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,461
Right... sorry. It was gruesome.

30
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:37,796
Never again. The EMTs said that

31
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,364
it was a meat pancake. I'm done.

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,832
So, tell us about the venue.

33
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,367
Oh, well, there's not much to tell...

34
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,102
other than it's a gorgeous mansion!

35
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:45,670
- Big ol' house!
- With a professional kitchen.

36
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,272
- Chop-chop, y'all!
- Ooh.

37
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,340
A private library for the ceremony.

38
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,341
My girl loves books!

39
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,375
Seven bathrooms!

40
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,676
No lines, ladies!

41
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:52,744
And an outdoor reception area.

42
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,413
Uh-can I get a gazebo?

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,783
I apologize to a host of communities.

44
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,668
The point is, these nuptials
are going to be "toit"!

45
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,554
Speaking of "toit nups,"
we better get going,

46
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,855
because we don't have
a lot of time and we have

47
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,090
to meet with 17 wedding vendors.

48
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,225
A jam-packed schedule
that could only be achieved

49
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,527
by a type-A personality!

50
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,228
- Jake.
- Yep, we gotta go.

51
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,097
<i>I have some unfortunate news.</i>

52
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,132
An NYPD officer has gone missing.

53
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:15,600
The department suspects foul play.

54
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,602
Oh, my God. Do we know the officer?

55
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,337
Yes, it's...

56
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,839
Sergeant Peanut Butter.

57
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,308
- My nemesis.
- Your nemesis is a horse?

58
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,743
Are you still mad at Peanut Butter

59
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,611
because he won a medal
the same day as you?

60
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,027
He totally upstaged me. He Tucci-ed me!

61
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:30,650
Look what you get
if you do an image search

62
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:32,818
of "Charles Boyle, medal of valor."

63
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,287
Huh? They cropped me out
of my own photo!

64
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,758
You just keep that tab open
on your phone all the time?

65
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:39,474
No, I just looked it up real fast.
You didn't see.

66
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,726
Captain, I solved it. Charles
kidnapped Peanut Butter.

67
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,629
I did not.
But it's no surprise that somebody did.

68
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,665
Hey, my kids love that horse.

69
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,568
Your kids need help wiping
their butts, Sarge.

70
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:50,702
They're not exactly geniuses.

71
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,171
The actual suspect is Jesse Gurmwald,

72
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,873
a disgruntled civilian admin

73
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,175
who was recently fired
by the mounted unit.

74
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,777
He's gone to ground,
but detectives throughout

75
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,213
the city are checking
every possible hideout.

76
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,782
Diaz, Boyle: here's a list
of locations in our precinct.

77
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,250
- Be thorough.
- Yes, sir.

78
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,798
And just to be clear,

79
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,854
if I went missing, you
guys would conduct

80
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,566
an equally thorough search, right?

81
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,358
You should get going.

82
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,360
So, we can wrap it in silk,

83
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,662
or, for a more rustic feel... burlap.

84
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,631
Oh... that's neat, but...

85
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,733
We want these nups to be toit.

86
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,468
- Excuse me?
- Could we wrap the flowers

87
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,338
in "New York Times" crossword puzzles
from key dates in our lives?

88
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,839
Oh... is that something you'd like?

89
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,742
Uh, boi-oi-oi-oi-oing!

90
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,844
Here's the deposit.

91
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,746
I designed you a signature cocktail.

92
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,314
I call it the "Peraltiago."

93
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,682
Ooh!

94
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:43,063
Mm... and the judges give
it a score of...

95
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,857
Jeremy, did you make that cake
that I called you about?

96
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,878
Yes, I wasn't entirely sure
if you were joking or not, but...

97
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,464
A Nakatomi Plaza cake?

98
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,232
The groom is on a licorice hose.

99
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,867
Welcome to the wedding, pal.

100
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,402
Oh, Amy.

101
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,905
These nups may be getting too toit.

102
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,274
Since Diaz and Boyle are
searching for Peanut Butter,

103
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,743
I need you to be available to work
any cases that might come in.

104
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,977
Of course, Captain. My pleasure.

105
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,273
Morning, Amanda.

106
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,281
Oh, and I thought we should transfer

107
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,216
the Glenmoore assault to the Nine-Eight.

108
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,851
Absolutely. Brian.

109
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,405
Looking swole.

110
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,488
You're looking swole. Is today leg day?

111
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,990
Legs for an hour, two hours
blasting the glutes.

112
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,226
Terry's got butt for days!

113
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,393
Excuse me?

114
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,496
I said, "Terry's got butt for days!"

115
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,797
Please stop talking about my body.

116
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,299
- What?
- I'm Teri.

117
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,600
You just said I had "butt for days."

118
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,602
Oh, I see what just happened.

119
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,903
Terry's gonna regret this.

120
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,538
- Are you threatening me?
- No!

121
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,187
No, no. This is a misunderstanding.

122
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,411
My name is also Terry,
and I was talking about my butt.

123
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,712
So you were complimenting your own body?

124
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,480
Well, I'm pretty proud of it.

125
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,782
Do you know how old I am?

126
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,351
Okay. Apology accepted.

127
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,237
Seems pretty arrogant, though.

128
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,755
This might not be the right time,

129
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,757
but talking about yourself
in the third person

130
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,726
- has finally...
- Terry knows!

131
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,429
- I love our venue so much.
- Me too.

132
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,965
It's like our very own Hogwarts.

133
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:01,902
- Yes! And I'm Hermione.
- Yes! And I am Snape.

134
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:03,301
- What?
- I never realized I could

135
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,270
have feelings this strong
about a building.

136
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,571
Okay, we just have to
drop off our deposit,

137
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,273
and then we're done for the day.

138
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,475
Well, it
would appear that we have achieved

139
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,877
what scholars refer to
as the "toitest of nups"!

140
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:13,979
Indeed!

141
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,914
Ooh!

142
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,415
Oh, hi Susan.

143
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,783
- Hey.
- We're normal people.

144
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,819
Hi, I was just about to call you guys.

145
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,622
Ah, well, no need to call,
because we are here.

146
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,890
- And we've got our deposit.
- Thank you so much.

147
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,460
We just booked all our vendors.
It's really happening.

148
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,961
Yeah, about that...

149
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,663
Wait, what's wrong? Something's wrong.

150
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,964
That's the look my mom
gave me right before

151
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,666
she told me that my dad left.

152
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,402
Oh, God, did my dad leave my mom again?

153
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:37,902
- How do you know my mom and dad?
- You know, I'm so sorry.

154
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,337
There must have been a mix-up.

155
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,006
Someone just contacted my manager

156
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,841
and booked the venue
before you got here.

157
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,876
But we had an oral agreement.

158
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,712
You said we had until
the end of the day... EOD.

159
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,981
It's not EOD. The D hasn't E'd.

160
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,850
It won't be E'd for ages!

161
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,868
I'm sorry. It's out of
my hands, you know?

162
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:55,771
Someone just swooped in and got it.

163
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:57,722
Wait. Susan... Susan!

164
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,325
Who? Who would do that?

165
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,060
Amy, we had something great
in the palm of our hands,

166
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,628
and then someone swooped
in at the last minute

167
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,063
and stole it?

168
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,564
There's only one person
who would do that.

169
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,533
No. But... it couldn't be!

170
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,634
Ah, but it is.

171
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,736
The Vulture!

172
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,471
Suckers.

173
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,774
Oh, no. Our nups have been un-toitened.

174
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,022
We've got loose nups.

175
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:21,086
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

176
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:22,721
What's your game here, Vulture, huh?

177
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,889
Why are you renting our venue?

178
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,157
Why do you think, meat farts?

179
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:26,925
- I'm getting married.
- Really?

180
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,727
You once told me that marriage
is for women and gays.

181
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,263
And that the only thing you're married
to is banging married chicks.

182
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:32,698
Yeah, and I meant it all.

183
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,434
But love? Love hath changed me.

184
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:37,803
No it hathn't.
You just vultured our venue.

185
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:39,358
Yeah, but I did it for love.

186
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:41,385
My fiancée, she means everything to me.

187
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:43,842
You know, she's hot like a chick,
she's smart like a guy.

188
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:45,210
Just talking to her
gives me a Harrelson.

189
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,278
- Harrelson?
- Woody.

190
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:47,946
- Ew.
- Yeah.

191
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:49,415
Look, I know I've become
that gross, sappy guy,

192
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,716
but dude, she's the first
chick I ever wanted

193
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:51,950
to hang out with post-bang.

194
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:53,975
I can't believe a real person
has agreed to marry you.

195
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:55,387
Oh, my lady's real, all right.

196
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:57,156
Her name is Jean Munhroe,

197
00:06:57,191 --> 00:06:59,058
and we complete the living hell
out of each other...

198
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:00,426
sometimes twice a night.

199
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,860
both groan]

200
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:03,095
Hey, you know what?

201
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,730
I need to handle this right now.

202
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:06,331
Look, I know how hard
it is to find a venue.

203
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,933
But if it could happen for me,
it could happen for you.

204
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:10,269
It happened for you because
it did happen for us.

205
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,503
Chins up, dingdongs.

206
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:13,238
I'm trying to be happy over here.

207
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:14,406
Ugh.

208
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:16,041
Jake, what are we gonna do?

209
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:18,010
We already gave deposits
to all our vendors.

210
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:19,344
We're gonna get this place back.

211
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,846
How? The Vulture's not gonna budge.

212
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:24,403
Yeah, maybe, but he does
have a weak spot: his woman.

213
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,452
Not that women are weak.
Just, she's our best shot,

214
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,020
- and she happens to be a woman.
- Totally.

215
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:29,922
Let's go talk to that spineless skank.

216
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:31,457
Yeah.

217
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,992
Why do we even have
police horses anymore?

218
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:36,128
We have motorcycles now.
They're faster, cooler.

219
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:37,863
They also don't get boners
in the background

220
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:39,865
of every photo of you and the mayor.

221
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,696
What do you mean?
A horse is a perfect partner.

222
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:43,302
Tough, scary, and they don't show you

223
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,238
30 pictures of their kid dressed
as Wario for Halloween.

224
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:47,706
I'm not talking about Nikolaj.

225
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:49,973
I literally just showed you
those pictures five minutes ago.

226
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,808
Really? I don't remember that.

227
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:52,809
Hmm.

228
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:59,051
NYPD! Hands where we can see 'em!

229
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:00,452
Step away from Peanut Butter.

230
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?

231
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:03,889
You guys thought you could catch me?

232
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:10,229
I'll head him off.

233
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:12,164
Fine, I'll get the dumb horse.

234
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,834
All right. Oh, boy, oh, boy.

235
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,269
Come on, you idiot!

236
00:08:19,273 --> 00:08:20,239
Run!

237
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:21,940
Ugh, you dumb horse.

238
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:22,975
Ha!

239
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:25,511
Peanut Butter!

240
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:32,217
Stop! Peanut Butter, stop!

241
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:33,585
- Stop!
- Boyle!

242
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:35,487
Just let go!

243
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:37,856
Okay, we have to force the She-Vulture,

244
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,859
Jean Munhroe, to give us our venue
back, so put on your game face,

245
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,327
'cause we're about to
stare down the devil.

246
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:44,496
Devil can't stare if the
devil's got tears in her eyes

247
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:45,597
and blood in her ears.

248
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,065
Oh, I love your intensity.

249
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,267
All right, this is where she works.

250
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:49,835
"The Zenith Fund."

251
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,436
Ulch, it even sounds evil.

252
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:53,005
Of course it is.
She's marrying the Vulture.

253
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,306
Everything about her is evil.

254
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:57,808
Time to enter the den of bastards
who deserve to die.

255
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:01,914
All right, snake, show your face...
it's a charity.

256
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,348
Amy, it's a charity.

257
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:05,417
Look at this: "Jean, your selflessness

258
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:08,704
"puts us all to shame.
Humbled, Michelle Obama."

259
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:11,056
Damn, Jean.

260
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:12,891
Hi. Can I help you?

261
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,294
Uh, yes. We're looking for Jean Munhroe.

262
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,362
- We know her fiancé.
- Oh, I'm Jean.

263
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:19,431
Are you Jake and Amy?

264
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:21,066
Keith has told me all about you.

265
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:22,634
- He says you guys are the best.
- Really?

266
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,204
- Keith says that?
- Yeah... oh, Janice?

267
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,439
That village needs rice.
Double the last shipment.

268
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:29,901
Just take the overage
out of my paycheck.

269
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,945
So, what brings you guys
to the Zenith Fund?

270
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,514
Uh... actually,
something super important...

271
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:37,149
Oh, I am so sorry.

272
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:39,184
- I've gotta take this.
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,802
What do you mean, "roadblock"?

274
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:42,888
Do I have to fly down there
and talk to the rebels myself?

275
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:44,456
Just get the rice to those kids.

276
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,665
<i>Asante sana, Rafiki.</i>

277
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:48,360
Sorry about that.

278
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:50,095
Wow, your job sounds very intense.

279
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,930
No, no, no, it's nothing
compared to what

280
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,565
these children go through
on a daily basis.

281
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:56,001
It really puts things in perspective.

282
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:57,102
- Right.
- So,

283
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:58,470
what was the important thing

284
00:09:58,505 --> 00:09:59,504
you came down here to talk about?

285
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,207
Uh... the kids.

286
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:04,443
- And the rice.
- And...

287
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,735
putting the rice... in the kids.

288
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:11,650
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have two new donors!

289
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,086
Yay!

290
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:15,487
Ooh, there's a bell.

291
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,089
Oh!

292
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:20,198
Do y'all have an ATM?

293
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:24,029
Sir, can I get $350 in petty cash?

294
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:26,598
I need to throw an ice cream party
for Teri-with-an-I, make sure

295
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:28,567
- there's no hard feelings.
- Why?

296
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:30,269
She gets it was a misunderstanding.

297
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:32,170
She's a Teri, and you're a Terrance who,

298
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:35,507
even though he's not a child,
still goes by a nickname ending in a Y.

299
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:38,076
I mean, don't people call you Ray?

300
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:39,344
How dare you.

301
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,013
Sir, I don't want any tension

302
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:43,348
between the squad
and the uniformed officers.

303
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:45,118
I'm just thinking about the precinct.

304
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:46,451
You're lying.

305
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,186
You're upset because
Teri-with-an-I called you

306
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:51,056
arrogant, and you have
a pathological need to be liked.

307
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,125
What? No, I don't.

308
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,993
I just happen to be a great person

309
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,628
who's naturally beloved by all...

310
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:58,887
despite my personal ambivalence.

311
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:02,034
Well, if that's true, then you won't
mind walking across the bullpen

312
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:04,369
without saying hello to anybody.

313
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:05,704
No problem.

314
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:07,472
No nods allowed.

315
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:08,607
What?

316
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:10,242
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

317
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:12,010
You're a busy sergeant.

318
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,179
They can't always expect you to
be friendly.

319
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:15,981
Time to go to frown town.

320
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:17,616
Let's do this, Jeffords.

321
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:19,017
- Hey, Sarge.
- Bill!

322
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,352
What up, man?

323
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,721
You were right.

324
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:24,990
Terry loves to be loved!

325
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,592
Hey, Monica! Hey, Dough.

326
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:30,362
Ooh, who wants a nod?

327
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:33,031
Hey. Any luck finding a new venue

328
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,633
- that's available on May 15th?
- Yeah.

329
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:37,002
May 15, 2026.

330
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:38,337
Please tell me the vendors
are giving us back

331
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:39,671
- our deposits.
- Yes.

332
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:41,306
One of them. The photographer.

333
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:42,741
Provided that you hang out with him,

334
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:44,176
so how do you feel about
spending the weekend

335
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:45,277
on his houseboat in Yonkers?

336
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:46,511
Ugh, Jake.

337
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:48,080
Forget the perfect wedding.

338
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:49,448
- We're screwed.
- I know.

339
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:52,217
I can't believe that saint of a woman
is actually marrying the Vulture.

340
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:53,785
Maybe he's changed.

341
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:55,087
- How is that even possible?
- I don't know.

342
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:56,288
Nothing makes sense anymore.

343
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:58,790
The Vulture's not the Vulture,
good is bad, up is down,

344
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:00,192
there's a young pope, winter has come.

345
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:02,394
That reminds me: I ordered
some premium cable channels.

346
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:06,498
Hitchcock? What was that sound?

347
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,367
I just got an alert from my hookup app.

348
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:11,269
I'm about to boink with a
local single in my area.

349
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:13,772
- Ames.
- Jake.

350
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:15,073
- Ames.
- Jake!

351
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,144
- Ames!
- Jake!

352
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,176
Up is up, down is down,
the Vulture still boinks!

353
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:20,965
I need to handle this right now.

354
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,898
I can't believe that bastard
is cheating on nice Jean.

355
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,583
We have to save her.
We have to break them up.

356
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,451
- For nice Jean!
- And the starving kids.

357
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:28,153
- And Michelle Obama.
- And a little side benefit:

358
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:29,970
if we break them up,
we get our venue back.

359
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:31,556
Yes, but the main reason
is to save a wonderful person

360
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:33,125
from making a horrible mistake.

361
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,526
Of course. That's obviously the point.

362
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:36,128
The venue is just secondary.

363
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:37,262
What venue? We're great people.

364
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:39,498
Hey, Jake.

365
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:41,294
See?

366
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,159
Okay, so the Vulture
is cheating on Jean Munhroe,

367
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:46,348
which totally tracks, because
he is the epitome of awful.

368
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:48,195
- Ooh, nice use of "epitome."
- Thanks, babe.

369
00:12:48,231 --> 00:12:49,697
My question is, why pretend to change?

370
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:51,198
I mean, why get married at all?

371
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:52,700
I'll tell you why.

372
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:54,835
Because Jean's dad
is worth $100 million,

373
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:56,370
and she's his only heir.

374
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:57,931
Then why did she need our $1,000?

375
00:12:57,967 --> 00:13:00,341
I mean, I'm so happy we gave the money

376
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:01,776
so the kids could have rice
and et cetera.

377
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:03,377
- So, how do we break them up?
- Simple.

378
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:04,945
We catfish him with
Hitchcock's hookup app.

379
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:07,314
Then, when he takes the bait,
we make him end things

380
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,250
with Jean respectfully and gently.

381
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:10,718
Perfect. She hurts for a bit,

382
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:12,286
but she eventually moves on,

383
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:13,454
and she finds a much better man.

384
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:16,223
Yes. And as a distant, secondary
benefit, we get the mansion back.

385
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:17,709
Agreed. Okay.

386
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:19,493
So, let's create a temptress

387
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:21,429
- that will boink-match with him.
- Yeah.

388
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:23,764
- What's the sexiest name?
- Valerie.

389
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:26,293
That was fast. Do you know a Valerie?

390
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:28,308
No. I wish.

391
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:30,805
All right, she's 19,

392
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,340
from Daytona, and her job
is "spray tannist."

393
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,276
Ugh, "tannist." Not a real word.

394
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:36,277
- It's perfect.
- Yeah.

395
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:37,712
Okay, she's into

396
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:39,780
spring break, bong rips, slurping shots,

397
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:42,004
and crop tops that say "little cutie."

398
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,987
- Noice.
- She is not into...

399
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,687
nerds, wearing pants,
needy guys, monogamy,

400
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:48,975
or feminism, and her quote is,

401
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,982
"Whatever happened
to 'Girls Gone Wild'?"

402
00:13:51,018 --> 00:13:53,360
This Valerie sounds like a real pill.

403
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:57,498
Okay. Let's see who our matches are.

404
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,567
Here we go.

405
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:01,244
Uh-huh.

406
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,570
Gross, mm-hmm.

407
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:04,726
Oh, Hitchcock.

408
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:07,508
I mean, "Dave, age 28"?

409
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:08,976
- Ugh.
- Come on.

410
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:10,511
- Oh!
- Gotcha.

411
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:12,429
There he is. All right.

412
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:14,238
And so begins the delicate dance.

413
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:16,293
We begin with a simple hello.

414
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:18,103
And then we wait, so as
not to seem too aggressive...

415
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:19,689
No, he sent us a picture of his penis!

416
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:22,389
Oh, God, he just sent 15 more.

417
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:23,591
Oh, God, it's horrible.
But it's wonderful.

418
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:25,206
We're gonna save Jean!

419
00:14:25,242 --> 00:14:26,427
Yes, and we're gonna
get the mansion back!

420
00:14:26,462 --> 00:14:28,477
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, he put a little hat on it.

421
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:29,545
Ugh.

422
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,499
Hey, there you are.

423
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:33,334
- You okay?
- Yeah, no burns.

424
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:35,402
The doctor said I was lucky
my body was so damp.

425
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:36,937
- So why did it take so long?
- Well, the EMT spent

426
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:38,439
loads of time on Peanut Butter.

427
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:39,507
But you know what?

428
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:42,984
I don't care, because I saved
that dumb horse, so I'm the hero.

429
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,367
And this time, when I get my medal,
my whole face will be in the picture.

430
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:48,706
- You haven't seen "The Post," have you?
- What? No.

431
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:49,884
- Why?
- Somebody was walking

432
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,419
by the fire and took a picture
on their cell phone.

433
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:55,589
What? That's not what happened.
I saved him.

434
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,957
That's not how they're reporting it.

435
00:14:56,993 --> 00:14:59,026
No, look. "Daily News" got it right.

436
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,494
Yeah.

437
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,897
"Hero Cop Saves Helpless Buffoon."

438
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:05,966
Oh, no. Am I the buffoon?

439
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,911
Uh-oh, dropped your phone.
Now we'll never know.

440
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:09,180
Wait.

441
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:10,749
There was a dash cam in the car.

442
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,339
We have footage of what really happened!

443
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,557
Brass already called. They don't
want us releasing that footage.

444
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:16,785
A hero horse is good PR
for the department.

445
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:19,457
Hey, man, uh...
Peanut Butter's going on "Ellen."

446
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:21,882
"Ellen"? That's my dream!

447
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:25,099
Now he gets to dance with DJ tWitch!

448
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:27,788
What's going on here?

449
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,708
I'm throwing Teri-with-an-I's
party with my own money.

450
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:32,390
I didn't know her favorite
kind of ice cream,

451
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,054
so I printed a photo of her
and showed it

452
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,616
to all the ice cream places
within 30 blocks.

453
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:39,834
Nobody recognized her,
so I got every flavor... 200 pints.

454
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:41,602
This is the greatest day of my life.

455
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:44,038
Have you considered
this Teri-with-an-I might not

456
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:46,540
- be an ice cream person?
- I did think that.

457
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:48,223
That's why there's a taco bar coming.

458
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:49,992
- Yes.
- Plus barbecue.

459
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:51,111
- Yes.
- Plus a popcorn guy.

460
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:52,680
- Yes.
- Plus vegan options.

461
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:53,781
- Why?
- Sergeant,

462
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:55,482
you've become unhinged.

463
00:15:55,518 --> 00:15:56,684
There's always gonna
be people in this world

464
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:57,751
who don't like you.

465
00:15:57,787 --> 00:15:58,986
That's a fact of life.

466
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:00,250
I hear you, sir.

467
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:02,656
But I hate the feeling
of people being mad at me.

468
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:04,425
So what?

469
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,126
I was voted least friendly
in high school,

470
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:07,595
and here I am, a police captain.

471
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,563
Do you know what Mr. Popularity

472
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,846
Vincent Mondale is doing these days?

473
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:13,734
He's a sociologist, for God's sake.

474
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:15,636
Sociologist, Terry.

475
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:17,471
I'm sorry, but I gotta do this.

476
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:19,374
Okay, but just know...

477
00:16:20,118 --> 00:16:22,151
if you go through with this party,

478
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:23,619
I will like you less.

479
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:27,982
Hello, Vulture. Got a minute?

480
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:29,617
Doesn't matter. We don't care.

481
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:31,418
Let me guess. You guys are here to cry

482
00:16:31,454 --> 00:16:32,753
about the wedding venue
that I stole from you

483
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,622
- fair and square, right?
- No.

484
00:16:34,657 --> 00:16:36,590
Actually, we wanna talk to you
about some other things.

485
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:39,193
Like spring break, slurping shots,

486
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:40,928
and hating pants.

487
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:43,352
Wait a second, why does
that sound familiar?

488
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:46,165
I don't know.
Maybe you should ask... Valerie.

489
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:48,202
Yeah, that's right. We catfished you.

490
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:49,870
- Boom.
- You're Valerie?

491
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:51,472
Ah, I can't believe I actually wasted

492
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:53,596
my sweet dong snaps on you bozos.

493
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:56,043
All right, here's how this is gonna go.

494
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:57,845
You are gonna break up with Jean,

495
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,681
because we all know you're just
marrying her for her money.

496
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:02,149
You're gonna do it nicely
and respectfully,

497
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:03,784
and you're gonna make
a generous donation

498
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:04,985
- to her charity.
- Nice touch, Ames.

499
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:06,186
You guys got it all wrong.

500
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:07,488
I don't care that she's rich.

501
00:17:07,523 --> 00:17:08,522
Look, I love her.

502
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:09,957
I just got spooked.

503
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:11,191
You put a vulture into a cage, and...

504
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:12,860
It freaks out.

505
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:14,495
Actually, vultures do
very well in captivity

506
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,864
- and they mate for life.
- Research burn.

507
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:20,104
All right, look. I'm deleting the app
from my phone as we speak, okay?

508
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,140
Come on. Jean's over 30.

509
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:23,691
No amount of money in the entire world

510
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:25,292
could make me marry a woman that old.

511
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:26,640
But love can. And will.

512
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:28,045
You have two options.

513
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,347
Either you break up with her...

514
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,078
Or we send her the penis pics...

515
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:33,747
even the one next to the...
I'm guessing, a mini soda can?

516
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:35,115
- Nah, it was regular size.
- Really?

517
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,584
Oh, Jean's here. So what's it gonna be?

518
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,187
You gonna tell her, or do we have to?

519
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:41,789
- I've changed.
- Nope.

520
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:43,123
- I won't do it again.
- Nope.

521
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:44,792
I'll give you the venue.

522
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:46,115
- Oh.
- What's that?

523
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:48,062
I'll give you the venue
if you don't say anything,

524
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:49,730
but if you do, I'm gonna keep it.

525
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:52,078
Even if she and I break up, all right?
I love her.

526
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,135
I promise you this.

527
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,703
- Deal.
- Okay.

528
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:57,237
Now just act normal, please.

529
00:17:57,273 --> 00:17:59,073
Oh, wow. What a surprise.

530
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:01,008
- My donors.
- Hello, Jean Munhroe!

531
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:03,495
Nice to see you, Jean Munhroe!

532
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:05,973
You all looked so intense
when I got here.

533
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:07,174
What were you talking about?

534
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,175
- Crime scene.
- Soup.

535
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:09,777
Uh... soup crime scene.

536
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:11,640
The Chowder Killer's back at it again.

537
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:13,409
Oh, I haven't heard of him.

538
00:18:13,445 --> 00:18:15,595
Yeah, well, he just moved
to Manhattan...

539
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:17,397
from New England.

540
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:19,895
You guys are so lucky
to all work together.

541
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:22,972
Oh, my gosh, what is Keith like at work?

542
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:25,042
Aw, Keith? Our Keith?

543
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:26,468
Well, he's a real crack-up,

544
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:27,670
I'll tell you that for free.

545
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,595
We have so many inside jokes.

546
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:31,019
- So many inside jokes.
- Mm-hmm.

547
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:32,714
Hey, guys... potato salad?

548
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:36,548
You wouldn't understand. It's from work.

549
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:38,116
Oh, my gosh, you guys are so crazy.

550
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:39,640
Yeah.

551
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:41,272
So how did you two meet?

552
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:42,943
Oh, someone stole from my charity,

553
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:44,979
and another detective was
working on the case so hard

554
00:18:45,014 --> 00:18:47,216
for months, and Keith came in,

555
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,486
and solved it right away.

556
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:51,306
Swooped in like an eagle.

557
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:53,309
That's why my nickname's the Eagle.

558
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:54,711
- Right, guys?
- Yep.

559
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:56,898
Everyone calls him...

560
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:58,692
The Eagle.

561
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:00,938
So, when did you decide to propose?

562
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,532
Oh... ah, well, we were
just hanging out one night,

563
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:07,835
and I looked over at Amy and it hit me.

564
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,038
She's incredible and my best friend,

565
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:13,174
and I just knew in that moment...

566
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:15,403
I wanted to spend my life with her.

567
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:18,099
I know what you mean.
Keith and I are the same way.

568
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:21,082
It is so nice to finally find
someone I can trust.

569
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:22,983
Oh, boy.

570
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:25,143
- I can't do this.
- Yeah, it's bad.

571
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,783
Jean, we have to show you something.

572
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:29,757
- No!
- A penis? Why?

573
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,984
Yep, should've explained it first.

574
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:34,765
Reese Witherspoon is optioning
the Peanut Butter story?

575
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:36,768
- What?
- Forget that dumb horse.

576
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:38,204
Have you seen this?

577
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:42,074
"Exclusive Dash Cam Footage Reveals

578
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,277
Hero Cop Saved Sergeant Peanut Butter."

579
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:46,544
I don't understand. How'd they get this?

580
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,746
Somebody must have leaked it.

581
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:49,163
Perfect partner isn't a horse.

582
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:51,846
The perfect partner is somebody who,
no matter how much they hate you,

583
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:52,980
would run through a fire
to save your life.

584
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:55,062
Aw. Thank you, Rosa.

585
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:57,609
You're welcome. All right, come with me.

586
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:58,986
We're going to Shaw's.

587
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:01,088
- Whoa, all this is for me?
- Yep.

588
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:03,715
You saved Peanut Butter,
even though he's a dick.

589
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:06,561
- He is a dick.
- To Charles Boyle, everybody!

590
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,259
To Charles Boyle!

591
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:09,897
Thanks, guys.

592
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:12,171
So, Terry, you decided
not to throw a party

593
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:14,073
- for Teri-with-an-I?
- You were right.

594
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:15,603
Why bother trying to win over a stranger

595
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:17,938
when I can make someone
I care about happy instead?

596
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:20,341
Well, for the record, Jeffords...

597
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:23,774
I like you a lot and I always have.

598
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,946
All right. Whatever.

599
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,724
I taught him well.

600
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,913
Who am I kidding? Terry needs a hug!

601
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:31,685
Mm?

602
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:35,199
Hey, I'm still a little shaken up.

603
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,158
- We did the right thing, right?
- Yes, definitely.

604
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:39,001
She's way better off without him.

605
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,261
And she let him know it.

606
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:42,026
Yeah, for a human angel,
girl could throw down.

607
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:43,495
I hate wasting rice...

608
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:45,761
but I hate you more!

609
00:20:45,797 --> 00:20:47,596
She may be the coolest woman
I've ever met.

610
00:20:47,632 --> 00:20:49,379
- Yeah.
- So, what's up with the wedding?

611
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,656
Do we need to find a new venue?

612
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,940
Actually, we found a place
that's available on the same date.

613
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:55,743
- Ooh, is it another mansion?
- No, it is not.

614
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:57,782
Listen up, everybody!

615
00:20:57,818 --> 00:20:59,041
We are getting married

616
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:01,073
- in a public rec center!
- Super cheap!

617
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,774
- On a basketball court!
- Squeak-squeak!

618
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,037
- With one working bathroom!
- Ladies gotta wait!

619
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:06,506
And it's in deep Staten Island.

620
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,055
Destination wedding, y'all!

621
00:21:08,507 --> 00:21:09,840
But the point is,

622
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:12,793
these nuptials are still gonna be...
mad toit.

623
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:14,128
I would marry you in a dumpster.

624
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:16,263
Aww, I would marry you in a dumpster.

625
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,784
Dudes, the Vulture's throwing

626
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,988
an all-girl pudding wrestling
party in a mansion in May!

627
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:24,808
It's the only important thing
happening that day!

628
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:27,117
- After party?
- Fits our budget.

Oh, please. He'll get over it.

633
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:45,434
No, I won't. You've
made an enemy for life.

634
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:47,303
And I'm telling Bruce Willis you suck.

635

[GUTTURAL GASP]

636
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:53,319
That's fine. I'm fine with that.

637
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:55,211
It's good. What's important is that

638
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:56,588
we made up, my best friend.

639
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,689
Not Bruce Willis.

640
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,082
<i>To Jake and Amy!</i>

641
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:01,684
ALL: To Jake and Amy!

642
00:21:01,753 --> 00:21:03,953
- [TOGETHER] To us!
- [GLASSES CLINK]

643
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:06,025
Hey, so I need to tell you something.

644
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:08,455
I had to cancel the wedding band,

645
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:10,993
because I kind of dated
one of the dudes in it.

646
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,383
Yeah, I know. Man bun.

647
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:14,174
He left me a very long message

648
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,199
- with a lot of details
- Oh, no.

649
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,000
He seems like a really passionate guy.

650
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,521
I'm never gonna live this down.

651
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,037
- No, you are not.
- [SOFT LAUGH]

652
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:22,349
I'm just kidding.
I'll never bring it up again.

653
00:21:22,373 --> 00:21:23,940
Thank you. You're the sweetest.

654
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,319
- I love you.
- I love you too, Turtle Bug.

655
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:27,477
- Oh, my...
- Yeah.

656
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:29,178
Uh, do I still need to be here?

657
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,772
Yes, Reginald. We're all toasted
and we need rides home!

658
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:35,284
[SOFTLY] It's Reginald VelJohnson!

1
00:00:00,276 --> 00:00:01,709
This installation is composed

2
00:00:01,744 --> 00:00:04,633
of Constantine's accounts
of the first Punic War

3
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:07,696
- in the year 264...
- Ah, yes the first pubic war,

4
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:09,532
the sexiest of all wars.

5
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,434
Hi, Dr. Albrin Einstibe.

6
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,148
I have an urgent question
for you about Ancient Greece.

7
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:16,338
- Shall we walk?
- Of course, Doctor...

8
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:17,673
I feel like you said Einstibe?

9
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,108
Yes, that's correct, it's a family name.

10
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:20,743
- What is going on?
- Captain Holt sent me.

11
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:22,478
Just follow my lead.
Your theory is wrong.

12
00:00:22,513 --> 00:00:24,980
The Greeks did not climb out
of the Trojan Horse's butt.

13
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:26,916
- Put this on.
- A rose shearing hat, at work?

14
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:28,884
- People will think I'm demented.
- Just put it on.

15
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:31,353
- Kevin, Dr. Einstibe.
- Ah, professor McGonagall.

16
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:33,536
- Why is Boyle dressed as me?
- Shh!

17
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:34,772
- Get in.
- But this cart is...

18
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:36,026
Get in!

19
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:42,654
- Professor.
- Student.

20
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:00,063
Hello, Kevin. It's me, Raymond Holt.

21
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:02,208
We need to get you to safety.
Your life is in danger.

22
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:20,985
<font color="#741b47">Sync & corrections by </font><font color="#ead1dc">emeline-whovian</font>
<font color="#741b47">www.addic7ed.com</font

23
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:24,453
Okay, so we've secured
Captain Holt's husband.

24
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:25,975
Let's discuss how to proceed.

25
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,611
So what you're saying is,
we need to talk about Kevin.

26
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:30,914
I have no regrets!

27
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:33,017
Kevin is currently at the
safe house with Captain Holt.

28
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,202
How long will he have to stay there?

29
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:35,978
My friend in the
Organized Crime division

30
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,386
says they've been building a case

31
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:39,588
against Seamus Murphy
for years, and they're close.

32
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:41,557
They think they'll move on him
in the next month or two.

33
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:43,559
So you're saying, Kevin can wait?

34
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,996
You know what, you people are insane.
That was gold.

35
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:49,765
Okay, two months in a safe
house... that's not impossible.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,474
It's nothing. I once stayed in my
apartment for 3 1/2 months straight.

37
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:55,099
- Was that after they cancelled "Bunheads"?
- Why would you bring that up?

38
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:57,406
I don't understand. Why can't
we just put Kevin into WITSEC?

39
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:59,008
The Murphys have killed three witnesses

40
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:01,043
in federal protection.
Captain doesn't wanna risk it.

41
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:02,711
We'll take shifts staying with Kevin.

42
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:04,713
No, it should just be me.

43
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:06,481
Look, it's my fault
that Murphy's after Kevin.

44
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:09,018
Captain Holt bailed me out,
and now it's my turn to bail him out.

45
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:10,819
Plus we've got this whole
tit for tat thing going,

46
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:12,588
and it's my time to tit.
It's my tit turn.

47
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:14,390
My time to tit is today, Terry.

48
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,958
You're gonna stay
locked up in a safe house,

49
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:17,793
away from us for two months?
That's going to be brutal.

50
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:20,062
- You just said it was nothing.
- Brutal for me, Gina.

51
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,931
Relax, I'm still going to be able

52
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,465
to text and chat with everyone.
It's not like I'm being

53
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,935
totally shut off from the outside world.

54
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,703
Say good-bye to the outside world.

55
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:29,371
You're in the safe house now,
so I'll need your phone.

56
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:31,507
- Why?
- Internet, cellular signals.

57
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:33,509
- They're too easy to trace.
- Seriously, no phone?

58
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:34,977
What am I supposed to do
to pass the time?

59
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:36,778
You could learn a foreign language.

60
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,614
Go to hell.

61
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:40,349
The "no internet rule"
was a shock to me as well.

62
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:41,717
I was hoping to salvage this time

63
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:42,999
to do research on my new book.

64
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:45,150
But apparently that
will not be possible.

65
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:46,554
I'm sorry, it's for your own safety.

66
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:48,791
Here, Peralta, let me give
you a tour of the safe house.

67
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:50,626
This is the living room.

68
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:52,061
- Oh.
- Stop!

69
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:53,862
You're entering the zone of visibility.

70
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:55,564
Someone could see you
through the windows.

71
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,999
Why don't we just close the blinds?

72
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:58,901
At mid-day? That's far too suspicious.

73
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,836
Blinds will only be closed at night.

74
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:03,672
If you must go into the living
room, crawl on your belly.

75
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:04,723
Observe.

76
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:08,811
Seems a little extreme.

77
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:10,880
You're right, it's extreme of me to try

78
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:13,224
to prevent my husband from
being shot in the face.

79
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,950
I'm over-doing it. Kevin, come in here.

80
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:16,652
- Take your bullet.
- No, fine.

81
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,621
- We'll stay on our bellies.
- Thank you.

82
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,789
This is one of several designated areas

83
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:22,458
where you can stand
upright during the day.

84
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,760
You can move about freely
in this square.

85
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:27,663
Wow, so we have
all this room to work in?

86
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:29,832
Your hand can be seen
from the living room window.

87
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,533
- You just killed Kevin.
- Raymond...

88
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:32,935
I can't hear you, Kevin. You're dead.

89
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,536
He bled out in your lap.

90
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,105
How will you break the news
to me? Let's see.

91
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,906
- We don't have to do this.
- Ah, Detective Peralta,

92
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:39,441
how are things going with Kevin,

93
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:40,371
the love of my life?

94
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,359
Wait, why are you here
at this late hour?

95
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:43,445
And whose blood is that?

96
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,847
- Okay, I get it.
- It's Kevin's?

97
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:46,815
This is devastating. I'm inconsolable.

98
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,861
And I've killed myself.

99
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,653
Cool, well, I can see this is

100
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,054
gonna be a fun couple of months.

101
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:53,890
- _
- <i>Okay, we can't stream anything,</i>

102
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,826
but I brought my DVD collection.

103
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,496
- Do you like Nic Cage movies?
- I don't know who that is.

104
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,599
Only the greatest and most
compelling actor of all time.

105
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:02,234
What are his movies like? Describe them.

106
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,004
Okay, well, one of them is

107
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,841
the FBI has developed
face-swapping technology.

108
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:08,139
Not interested.

109
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:10,716
- There's a whole plane full of convicts.
- Nope.

110
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,041
On the back of the original

111
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:14,309
Declaration of Independence,
there's a hidden treasure map!

112
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:15,878
- Stop.
- But that's the smartest one!

113
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:16,849
_

114
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:18,647
Oh my God, I'm so glad
Captain Holt finally agreed

115
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:20,516
to let you come visit.
I missed you so much.

116
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,771
Me too.

117
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:26,188
Um... is there a way we
could get a bit more privacy?

118
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,992
Just pretend I'm not here.
God knows I am.

119
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:30,903
_

120
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,977
Okay, I think you're actually
going to like this one.

121
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:34,213
Nic Cage is a chemist...

122
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:35,564
Interesting, keep going.

123
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:36,932
Who has to break into Alcatraz...

124
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,288
Absolutely not!

125
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:43,238
Are there no other actors?

126
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:46,390
It's Captain Holt.

127
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,222
- Hello, Captain.
- And... you're both dead.

128
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,381
You didn't ask for the password.

129
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,383
What if I were an assassin

130
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:56,952
wearing a hyper-realistic latex mask?

131
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:59,421
Or perhaps you employed
"Face/Off" technology.

132
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:00,556
- What?
- I broke down

133
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,591
and watched one of
Peralta's action films.

134
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:04,173
I'm lying, I watched them all,

135
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,461
including one wherein a man's head

136
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:06,762
turns into a flaming skull.

137
00:05:06,797 --> 00:05:08,611
"Ghost Rider", and "Ghost Rider 2."

138
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:09,631
Both master-pie.

139
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,999
Yes, I need your help, Raymond.

140
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:12,835
Luckily, I come bearing good news.

141
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,870
My friend in the Organized Crime unit

142
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,872
tells me that they're moving
against Murphy tonight.

143
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:18,540
- Oh, my God, really?
- You're serious?

144
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:20,309
You mean to say this could be ending?

145
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:21,877
Peralta, it's happening.
It's finally happening.

146
00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:23,912
Call everyone, we'll get
a live feed of the raid

147
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:25,647
and have a viewing party.

148
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:28,016
"Tie a yellow ribbon
round the old oak tree,

149
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:29,718
'cause this boy's comin' home."

150
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:30,803
"Con Air".

151
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,554
What have I become?

152
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,323
Oh, yes, people.

153
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:35,958
Actual real people that aren't Kevin.

154
00:05:35,993 --> 00:05:37,993
- Hi, I want to touch you.
- Babe, you're being weird.

155
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:39,795
Right, sorry. I forgot how to be human.

156
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,330
- Yeah.
- Oh, Charles!

157
00:05:41,365 --> 00:05:42,865
- Ah.
- I need to hear your voice,

158
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,099
Tell me what I've been
missing at the nine-nine.

159
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:45,567
Ooh, Terry's grandma got really sick

160
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:47,336
and had to spend a month
in the hospital.

161
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:49,104
Oh... that's sad.

162
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,573
I more meant like funny work anecdotes.

163
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:52,908
Ah, Scully sat on a cherry pie

164
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,409
and he didn't notice for six hours.

165
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:56,111
The tin stayed on the whole time.

166
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:57,913
Now we're talking.
Did you take a picture?

167
00:05:57,948 --> 00:05:59,081
Honestly, I didn't see it.

168
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:00,516
I was at Terry's grandma's funeral.

169
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,080
- Come on.
- Everyone, quiet down.

170
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:04,820
The feed is live and the raid
begins in T-minus 60 seconds.

171
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:06,455
In one minute, Kevin and I
will finally be able

172
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,290
to leave this awful place.

173
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:09,958
And yet we'll never
be free of the nightmares.

174
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:11,760
No, those shall haunt us for always.

175
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:13,629
Whoa, things got
really intense in here, huh?

176
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,397
Oh, yeah, it got dark.
This place is a hell-mouth.

177
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:16,899
- Cool.
- Shh! They're about to move.

178
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:18,600
<i>- Bravo team, stand by.</i>
- I love this.

179
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:20,002
I feel like Ellen watching her producers

180
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:21,537
go through a haunted house.

181
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:23,159
<i>- Breach, breach!</i>
- They're in.

182
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:25,374
<i>- There's nobody here.</i>
- Uh-oh, the house is empty!

183
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:27,309
No, no, no, no, no, no. Where's Seamus?

184
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:28,577
I don't understand, what's happening?

185
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:30,148
Someone must have tipped them off.

186
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,252
The raid is a bust,
and Murphy's still at large.

187
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:33,370
So what you're saying is...

188
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:35,500
Everyone on the ground, immediately!

189
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,886
Oh no, I sat in another pie.

190
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:39,321
Damn it! Next time, sit on a pie

191
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:41,419
when we can enjoy it, Scully.

192
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:43,409
Organized Crime is hunting for Murphy,

193
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,432
but we can't just sit back
and hope they find him.

194
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:46,952
Diaz, where are you with your CI?

195
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,854
They said Seamus' girlfriend Nikki works

196
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:51,580
- in a hair salon in Bay Ridge.
- Nice, classic mistress job.

197
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:53,261
Hey, my girlfriend's a hairdresser!

198
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:54,877
And you cheated
on your ex-wife with her.

199
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:56,318
Checkmate. Well played.

200
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:57,899
Okay, Nikki won't talk to cops.

201
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,393
So we've got to send
someone in as a customer.

202
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:00,877
Get her to open up, start gossiping.

203
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:03,001
Send me. I'm a gossip surgeon.

204
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:04,367
I can get anything out of anyone.

205
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:06,270
You can't go undercover,
you're not a cop.

206
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:09,317
How am I not a cop, Terry?
'Cause I don't have a badge?

207
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:12,076
- Being a cop is a state of mind.
- It's definitely not.

208
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:13,316
Diaz, the mission is yours.

209
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,685
Great. I love strangers
touching my head.

210
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,664
Sorry, you don't
have a choice. Dismissed!

211
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,700
Actually, Sarge, I have a lead too.

212
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:21,669
I found the place that
provides shredding services

213
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:24,005
for Murphy's companies.
I subpoenaed those shreds.

214
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,341
We can piece them together.

215
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:27,310
Smart. How many shreds are we talking?

216
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:28,378
A few.

217
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:29,683
Oh, crap.

218
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,114
According to Organized Crime,

219
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,117
Murphy has gone to ground,
and there are no leads.

220
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:35,620
Oh, that's great. If he's on the run,

221
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,857
he probably won't
be worrying about Kevin.

222
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:39,118
And if you coat yourself
in chum and swim with sharks,

223
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:40,987
you probably won't be eaten.

224
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:43,316
Said the half-eaten
chum-covered swimmer.

225
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:45,443
While Murphy is at large,
he's still a threat.

226
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:47,411
So I'm going to be stuck here forever,

227
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:48,659
following these over-the-top
security precautions?

228
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:49,672
- No.
- Thank God.

229
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:51,295
The security procedures
are about to become

230
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,466
much more over-the-top.

231
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:55,029
Say good-bye to your one hour
of open window time.

232
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:57,999
But sir, the stench.
It needs some way to escape.

233
00:07:58,034 --> 00:07:59,757
I already feel as though
I'm trapped inside of...

234
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,092
What are those things
you're always eating?

235
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:02,594
- Pizza bagels? Pizza rolls?
- No. No.

236
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:03,961
- Pizza poppers? Pizzaritos?
- No. No.

237
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:05,329
- Pizza pockets?
- That's it.

238
00:08:05,364 --> 00:08:06,997
How much longer will I be forced to live

239
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:08,899
- inside this pizza pocket?
- Look, I could tell you

240
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:10,100
that it'll just be a few more weeks,

241
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,535
but you don't want me to lie to you.

242
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,471
Raymond, I beg of you. Give me two hours

243
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,272
at the library to work
on my book... just two hours.

244
00:08:15,307 --> 00:08:16,679
It will make all the difference.

245
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:18,079
Yeah, I could go with him,
keep him safe.

246
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:20,582
No library. Seamus' men
could be lurking in the stacks.

247
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:22,785
- I find that unlikely.
- I understand, but I disagree.

248
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,955
Well then, we are in disagreement.

249
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,718
You'll have to excuse me.

250
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,235
I'm sorry you had to witness
such a vicious fight.

251
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,171
- Oh, was that a fight?
- Are you kidding?

252
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:38,220
He said "you'll have to excuse me"
instead of "please excuse me."

253
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:41,323
Might as well have spit in my face.

254
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,292
_

255
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:45,503
Okay, first of all,
Rosa, you look amazing.

256
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,872
Secondly, I made an
appointment at the salon

257
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,306
with Nikki, for you, under the name

258
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:51,442
Gabriella Fuentes de San Miguel Estrada.

259
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:52,954
- I had fun with the name.
- Clearly.

260
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:53,812
Here's the plan.

261
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:56,830
Gabriella Fuentes de San Miguel
Estrada gossips about her love life.

262
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:58,817
Then, Nikki opens up about hers.

263
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:00,578
Yeah, this is the problem.
I suck at gossiping.

264
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:02,613
Which is why I brought
along a specialist.

265
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:05,923
Gina will be in your ear
feeding you stories.

266
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,906
I will be basing Gabriella
on my sister's friend, Dana.

267
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:11,709
Just be warned... Dana real sloppy.

268
00:09:11,744 --> 00:09:14,899
So, Nikki, I always wanted
to get my hair cut here.

269
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,367
Everyone says you're the best.

270
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:20,072
Oh, my God, I love your earrings.

271
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:22,908
Where did you get those hoops?

272
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,623
Mmm, I don't know.

273
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:26,892
Oh no, Nikki's not a talker.
We're screwed.

274
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:30,787
Don't worry angel, Gina's
got this, crackety-crack.

275
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,552
Rosa, repeat after me
and don't change a thing.

276
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:37,345
Can I tell you the craziest story?

277
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,490
One time I was like so drunk...

278
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,358
And this meathead comes up to me.

279
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:43,260
And his body is hot,
but his face is like okay.

280
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:45,162
So I'm like, what?

281
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:47,932
And I was like, bitch,
I'm not gonna sleep with you

282
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,334
just because you promised
to take me to the Bahamas.

283
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:52,002
Take me to the Bahamas first

284
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:53,767
and then we'll see what happens, okay?

285
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,174
I was only with him
because he drove a Jaguar.

286
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:58,576
Turns out it was a Mercury

287
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,477
with a Thundercat taped to the hood.

288
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,851
And that relationship
lasted for three months.

289
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:05,499
I don't know why we broke up.
I guess we just grew apart

290
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:07,070
when he went to prison for life.

291
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:08,567
I hear that.

292
00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:12,733
The guy I'm seeing
is into some shady stuff.

293
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:13,926
Right?

294
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,529
There it is, the breakthrough.
Follow up, follow up!

295
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:18,085
So, how'd you guys meet?

296
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,140
That's a funny story, for next time.

297
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,434
You're all done, and you look hot, girl.

298
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:24,657
<i>No, no, she was opening up.</i>

299
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,659
Rosa, figure out a way
to stay in that chair.

300
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:30,056
Hey, Nikki, I was just wondering.

301
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,777
How do you think I would look...

302
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:34,203
as a blonde?

303
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,513
Like a Danielle Steele novel.

304
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,552
Good oranges, nice and dry.
Not at all ripe.

305
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:43,206
Fascinating.
My orange is beginning to rot.

306
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:44,989
That happens when you leave an orange

307
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,457
sitting around for too long

308
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:48,525
and refuse to even let that
orange go to a library

309
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,527
for two hours so it can feel
like a real orange again.

310
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:52,491
You know what really
causes an orange to go bad?

311
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,208
Getting shot.
Have you seen what a bullet

312
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:55,577
does to an orange?

313
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,418
I shot a watermelon once.

314
00:10:58,337 --> 00:11:00,337
It's exactly what you want it to be.

315
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:02,373
- I miss Amy.
- You think I enjoy doing this?

316
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,141
I assure you, I do not.

317
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:05,763
I'm simply trying
to keep my husband alive.

318
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,200
Well, you may not have a husband
when all of this is over.

319
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,835
You're not going to die, Kevin.

320
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:11,518
That's not what I meant.

321
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,789
I'm leaving.
This is an absurd conversation,

322
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:18,332
and you're being ridiculous.

323
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:27,398
You know what, screw this.
We need a break.

324
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,566
I'm a cop, I can protect us.
We're going to the library.

325
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,717
These two oranges are stepping out.

326
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:34,604
Oh, damn it, peeling out.
It was right there!

327
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:37,437
Okay, Captain Holt has
back-to-back meetings

328
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:38,873
at One Police Plaza today,

329
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,207
which means we have a four-hour window

330
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,031
before he checks on any
of the security feeds.

331
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:44,042
But going out into public
is a huge risk,

332
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:46,512
so maybe let's go over some
self-defense techniques.

333
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:51,125
Usually, you warn somebody
before you do that.

334
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,195
Raymond told me that the element
of surprise was crucial.

335
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,499
Cool.

336
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:56,936
So he's a great teacher.
But I will say this.

337
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:58,229
If you're going to do a throat punch,

338
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:01,669
it is key that you say something cool
afterwards like, "choke on that."

339
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:04,219
But they're not choking.
They're experiencing airway trauma.

340
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:05,445
Ooh, how about,

341
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,330
"Better get some corticosteroids
to treat that laryngeal fracture."

342
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:09,900
Okay, yeah, that's very informative

343
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:11,300
and quite polite.

344
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:13,516
But maybe add a "dirtbag" on the end?

345
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:15,133
But a dirtbag is a
useful part of a vacuum.

346
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,792
I don't see how it's an insult.

347
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:18,110
All right, you know, puncher's choice.

348
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,093
Moving on, we're going
to need disguises.

349
00:12:20,128 --> 00:12:22,077
And since we're going
to a public library,

350
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:23,315
the best way to fit in is as...

351
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,984
- Scholars.
- Weird perverts.

352
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,940
Yes, weird perverts is far better.

353
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:27,986
Far better.

354
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:43,750
What is the bandwidth on the wifi here?

355
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:46,653
We have much content to stream.

356
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:51,643
Bam! Solid match.
Okay, I've got three words.

357
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:54,709
I've got an "and",
I've got an "an" and a "he".

358
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:56,809
Now, the "he" could be a part of a "the"

359
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:58,807
or the end of "Apache."

360
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:01,785
I don't know why, but I'm
getting a strong "Apache" vibe.

361
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:04,089
Amy? Amy?

362
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:06,823
- Amy, where'd you go?
- Down here.

363
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,570
I let the pile take me.

364
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,095
I don't know what I was thinking.

365
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:12,560
We've been at it for two hours

366
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:14,496
and all we've got is three words.

367
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:17,033
Really two.
Terry's just fooling himself.

368
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:18,946
"Apache's" a long shot at best.

369
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,839
Ooh, are you guys building a nap nest?

370
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,308
- Mind if we burrow?
- No!

371
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,609
We're piecing together
shredded documents

372
00:13:23,644 --> 00:13:25,845
- to find Seamus Murphy.
- Can I help?

373
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:28,380
I'm really good at jigsaw puzzles.
I do them all the time.

374
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:30,778
It's why my wrist muscles
are so defined.

375
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:32,931
No offense, Scully,
but you can't be good or bad

376
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:34,233
at jigsaw puzzles.

377
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:36,321
It's just putting shapes together.

378
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:39,554
There's no strategy
or reasoning, or logic...

379
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,460
Look, I got half a page!

380
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:44,613
He is the one.

381
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,867
This is great. There's nobody here.

382
00:13:46,903 --> 00:13:48,694
Everyone cleared out
as soon as we got here.

383
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,134
Even that actual pervert
was creeped out by us.

384
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:54,672
I can feel your heat.

385
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:58,677
Ooh! No offense, but it feels
so good to breathe air

386
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,345
that didn't come out of your mouth.

387
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,533
- None taken.
- Ooh, I know you're working,

388
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:04,449
but you should probably put
something on your screen perverted

389
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:06,185
in case someone comes in

390
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,086
like a lady in high heels
stepping on a businessman.

391
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:09,488
Sorry, yes, I meant to do that.

392
00:14:09,523 --> 00:14:11,189
I've just gotten so
wrapped up in my research.

393
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,825
I've been reading
the most thrilling footnote.

394
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,443
- What was that?
- I don't know.

395
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,031
But don't worry...

396
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:21,972
I'll creep them
right the hell out of here.

397
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:26,658
Hello... who's sneaking
around back here?

398
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:28,189
Bang, you're dead. And so is Kevin.

399
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:29,355
Oh, thank God, it's just you.

400
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:30,982
Wait, no, this is bad
in a different way.

401
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:32,144
What are you doing?

402
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,612
You brought my husband
to a public place?

403
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:36,031
He's undercover. We're perverts, see?

404
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:37,500
You're not fooling anyone.

405
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:38,850
Kevin's zipper is up, for God's sake.

406
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:41,620
Wait, I'm confused... how did
you even know we were here?

407
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,832
Oh, my God, you sewed a tracker
into my neck, didn't you?

408
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:46,261
Don't be stupid.

409
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:48,334
The trackers are in your shoes,
underwear, and wallet.

410
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,734
I also braided one into your hair.

411
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,852
In my tangle?

412
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,077
You put my husband at risk,
and for what?

413
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:54,691
Because you felt a little cooped up?

414
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,676
That's not it.

415
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:58,303
- You could have cost him his life.
- What life, Raymond?

416
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,868
I spend every day lying
on the floor of that house

417
00:15:00,904 --> 00:15:03,492
talking with Jake about popular culture.

418
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,838
Do you know what it means
to "clap back", Raymond?

419
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:07,346
Be-cause-I-do.

420
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:09,181
Enough. We have to get back
to the safe house immediately.

421
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:12,286
Let's go. And if you're
gonna be a pervert, Kevin,

422
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:13,755
adjust yourself as you walk.

423
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,754
Move some quarters
around in your pocket.

424
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,326
So I used to see my
boyfriend on Friday nights

425
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:19,837
after his wife went to bed,

426
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:21,938
but then he left town
a couple of weeks ago.

427
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:23,795
You're all done here, gorgeous.

428
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,532
Ahhhh-ha-ha, I love it!

429
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:29,301
But finish what you were saying.

430
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:30,702
Where'd your boyfriend run off to?

431
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,472
Oh, that's a story for next time.

432
00:15:33,507 --> 00:15:35,208
Rosa, we're so close, you can't leave.

433
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:38,184
Tell her you want a perm. I want a perm.

434
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,587
A big ol' perm.

435
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:41,113
Great idea.

436
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,084
_

437
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:52,289
_

438
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:58,430
_

439
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,301
_

440
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,793
_

441
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:20,231
_

442
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:25,068
_

443
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:28,185
_

444
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,340
Go, go, go!

445
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,437
Take a seat.

446
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:52,992
I can't believe someone took Raymond.

447
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:54,285
He had a gun, Jake.

448
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:55,760
It'll be okay. We're gonna get him back.

449
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,556
Let me just call the nine-nine.

450
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,259
Hey, Rosa, do you guys have any
idea where Seamus Murphy is?

451
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:02,527
We have a huge problem.

452
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,296
Yeah, we all have huge problems.

453
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:06,466
You kinda look like Phil
Spector when he was on trial.

454
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:08,569
Guys, focus up. Have you found anything?

455
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:10,451
One of Murphy's guys just took Holt.

456
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,287
Oh, no. We did get something from Nikki.

457
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,323
Apparently, Seamus has been staying up

458
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,324
- in Rhinebeck, New York.
- Rhinebeck?

459
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:18,394
Scully, where's that piece of junk mail

460
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:19,661
with the Rhinebeck address?

461
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:22,097
- Scully, surface!
- Yes, Sarge?

462
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:24,266
- Rhinebeck letter.
- One sec.

463
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,092
- 8221 Oak Ridge Parkway.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

464
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:33,928
All right, we're going
to commandeer a car,

465
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:35,402
and then we're going
to drive to Rhinebeck.

466
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:38,411
No one is going to hurt
your husband... this I swear.

467
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,682
Ow, owie, owie, owie, it stings, ow!

468
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:44,601
Oh, ho, ho. Follow me.

469
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:48,657
Hello, Raymond.

470
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,259
So Seamus, are you going to kill me?

471
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:52,361
No, don't be stupid, nothing like that.

472
00:17:52,396 --> 00:17:53,899
I'm just going to find your husband,

473
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:55,468
bring him here, slit his throat
in front of you,

474
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:58,569
then, after you watch
him suffer, kill you too.

475
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:03,946
- There it is... 8221.
- All right, let's go.

476
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,515
What? No, you're not coming in.

477
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:06,904
It's way too dangerous for a civilian.

478
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,210
You're driving back to the safe house

479
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:09,778
and watching another Nic Cage movie.

480
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:11,713
You still haven't seen
"Gone in 60 Seconds."

481
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,649
His character's name is
Memphis Raines. I'm so sorry.

482
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:16,218
No, I'm not abandoning
my husband. I love him.

483
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:18,320
Yeah, I love him too.
Everybody loves Raymond.

484
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:20,155
- Don't.
- I think that's pretty funny!

485
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:21,357
- No.
- It doesn't matter.

486
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,982
You got to go. Get the hell
out of here, I got this.

487
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,012
Sir!

488
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:39,474
Hey there.

489
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:44,546
- Where is Kevin?
- Don't worry, he's safe.

490
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:47,649
Look, Captain, I just want
to say that I'm sorry.

491
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:49,384
You should be.

492
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:51,432
You should have abided
by my security rules.

493
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:53,322
You're right. But I want you to know,

494
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:54,556
I didn't take Kevin to the library

495
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,625
because I was stir-crazy.

496
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,695
It was because I didn't want
you guys to get divorced.

497
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:00,933
How is that any concern of yours?

498
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:02,330
I don't know, I just...

499
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,833
I've been around so many
failed marriages in my life.

500
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:07,236
You know, first my mom and my dad,

501
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,105
then Charles and Eleanor,
Hitchcock and Brandi,

502
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,141
Hitchcock and Francine,
Hitchcock and Brandi again,

503
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:15,344
- Hitchcock and Madison...
- Madison wasn't his daughter?

504
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:17,112
But he dropped her off
at college last fall.

505
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:19,348
I know, it was really gross.
But the point is,

506
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:21,896
I just couldn't stand
to see you two fall apart.

507
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:24,185
Perhaps I should have been
more understanding

508
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:26,065
of what Kevin was going through.

509
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:28,872
I may die here tonight,

510
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:31,527
and his last memory of me will
be how miserable I made him.

511
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:35,363
So, Peralta, what do
you have to say for yourself?

512
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,798
The whole NYPD knows where you are,

513
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,700
and they're coming for you right now.

514
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,602
Okay, thanks for the tip.

515
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,370
Let's kill them both, get out
of here before the cops come.

516
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:44,128
Wait, no, no, no,
I was lying about the back-up.

517
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:45,798
I came alone... title of my sex tape.

518
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:49,006
Doesn't matter.
You're both gonna die now.

519
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:57,863
Better get some corticosteroids

520
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,632
to treat that laryngeal fracture.

521
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:01,523
Sorry, I couldn't bring myself
to call him a dirtbag.

522
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,292
And why would you?
A dirtbag is a very useful part

523
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,562
of the vacuum cleaner.
Clearly, it's a compliment.

524
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:08,463
Wow, you guys
are so perfect for each other.

525
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,732
<i>Oh, my garsh!</i>

526
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:13,914
It's all the same. Nothing has changed.

527
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,948
- Except for that.
- This perm saved your life.

528
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,507
And I thank it for its service.

529
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:21,376
Hello, Captain. Hello, Kevin.

530
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:23,595
So, here's an update on Seamus.

531
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:25,431
Thanks to our little operation,

532
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:28,660
the FBI was able to roll up
his entire organization.

533
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,018
They're saying it's going to be

534
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:32,613
one of the most significant RICO
prosecutions they've ever done.

535
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,168
- Amazing.
- It's over now.

536
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:37,225
He can't hurt me or Kevin.
Thank you, for titting my tat.

537
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,124
Well, thank you for tatting my tit.

538
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,526
And you know, in a weird way,

539
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:41,726
I'm going to miss our little house.

540
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:43,131
Yes, and in an even weirder way,

541
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,167
I think I might actually miss you.

542
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:48,626
And in an even weirder way,
I want you guys to be my dads.

543
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:50,672
- That is weirder.
- Yeah, I got stuff.

544
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,140
I brought you your box of DVDs.

545
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:54,012
Oh, thank you.

546
00:20:54,444 --> 00:20:56,396
Oh! Forgot about this one.

547
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:58,766
We never watched
"Captain Corelli's Mandolin."

548
00:20:58,802 --> 00:21:00,482
What the hell did you just say?

549
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,893
- "Captain Corelli's Mandolin"?
- Say that to my face.

550
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:05,253
"Captain Corelli's Mandolin"?

551
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:06,655
There was a movie about a mandolin,

552
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,423
and you kept it from me for two months?

553
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,758
Well I didn't think it was any good.

554
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:11,126
- It's just some period piece.
- What?

555
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:12,361
- Set in Greece.
- Oh, my God.

556
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,137
Based on some dumb book. Aah!

557
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,963
Terribly sorry. It has
been a very trying time.

558
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,532
Yeah, next thing, you're
going to say you'd wished

559
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:20,835
we had watched "Leaving Las Vegas,"

560
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:22,137
a dark, ponderous
reflection on alcoholism

561
00:21:22,172 --> 00:21:23,405
that earned Cage his Oscar.

562
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,208
- Aah!
- What?

563
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,842
I told you, the guy's got range!

564
00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:31,877

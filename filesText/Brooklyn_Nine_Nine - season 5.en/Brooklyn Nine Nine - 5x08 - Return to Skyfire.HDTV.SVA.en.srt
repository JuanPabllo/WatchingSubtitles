1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:01,541
Hey, Jake,

2
00:00:01,576 --> 00:00:02,842
guess who just called me?

3
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:04,588
The Jerky Boys. They're back!

4
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:05,794
No. What?

5
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:07,031
- No.
- No.

6
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:09,915
D.C. Parlov. He's in town for LegendCon,

7
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:11,024
and he has a case for us!

8
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,051
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

9
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,880
Parlov? Didn't he write
those "Skyfire" books?

10
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:16,184
I thought he turned out to be a jerk.

11
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,540
Yeah, but ever since Jake
and I saved his life,

12
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:20,405
he's actually been very nice.

13
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,873
He even sent me a Christmas gift.

14
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:25,442
A full-scale replica of
the sword of Opadoma.

15
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,126
- Unh!
- Why are you so excited?

16
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,431
You don't care about those stupid books.

17
00:00:28,437 --> 00:00:30,356
I actually did read all
of them in prison.

18
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:31,581
They are the greatest books I've

19
00:00:31,587 --> 00:00:33,016
ever read, and I've read "Cujo."

20
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:35,330
Jake and I really bonded over "Skyfire."

21
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:36,668
- Yeah.
- Watch this.

22
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,079
Favorite moment in the series?

23
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:40,105
The summoning of Balacastro.

24
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,630
- Second favorite?
- The Scarlet Feast!

25
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:44,777
- Third favorite?
- When you thought Ka'lar

26
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:46,311
had been swallowed by the Norolith,

27
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:47,846
but had just switched armor

28
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,448
with Samling the Betrayer

29
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,150
in the battle of Vorcastle.

30
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,618
Fourth favorite?

31
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:54,305
Three was plenty. So was zero.

32
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,297
Okay, I can see that
you're skeptical, Rosa,

33
00:00:56,303 --> 00:00:58,615
but how about this: come
with us on the case!

34
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,688
I know you think it's dumb,
but "Skyfire" is actually

35
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,661
very smart and dark and adult.

36
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,029
It's not for nerds at all.

37
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,431
Ooh! On our way there,

38
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,809
should we sing the elvish hunting song?

39
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,268
♪ Sharpen your swords ♪

40
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,569
♪ And string your bows ♪

41
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,104
♪ The beasts have gone away ♪

42

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,359
Whoa, look at this place!

44
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:36,628
Ooh, they're selling moss wine.

45
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:39,064
I wonder if it's as gross
as the books say it is.

46
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,732
I can never get into any of this crap.

47
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,534
I think the reason is
because it's garbage.

48
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,169
Rosa, I think if you
just gave it a chance,

49
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,127
you would get hooked.
I mean, what is it that

50
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,845
you do in your free time that's so cool?

51
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,641
Fix up old cars and sell
them to celebrities.

52
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:51,343
That's why I'm friends with Tom Hardy.

53
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,144
Right, so we agree that
we're all equally cool.

54
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,680
Here we go. This is Parlov's panel.

55
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,582
"Diversity in Fantasy Writing."

56
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,350
Ooh, the line starts here.

57
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:01,789
Real diverse diversity panel.

58
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:03,595
And, like, people always ask me,

59
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,900
"Where do you get your ideas?"

60
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:06,969
And honestly, Wikipedia.

61
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:08,561
I always try to pull from life.

62
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,406
Queen Tiffany, of
course, was named after

63
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:11,674
a lovely hostess that I met

64
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,324
in Bonita Springs in Florida.

65
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,611
You know, I've always wanted
to write a book myself,

66
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:17,813
but all I know about is cops,
and there are literally

67
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:19,340
no more cop stories to tell. Zero.

68
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:21,495
- I've actually been writing a novel.
- Wait, what?

69
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:23,511
You're writing a book? When? For who?

70
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:24,987
For me... for fun.

71
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:26,589
Look, I'm not trying to be an author.

72
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,163
I don't even know how
to go about doing that.

73
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,165
Parlov! You should show it to Parlov.

74
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:33,235
- He could probably get it published.
- No, that's crazy.

75
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,690
Like, I'm sure it's bad. I
don't want to be embarrassed.

76
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,573
Terry, you are a great husband,

77
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:39,441
father, detective, painter, dancer,

78
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:41,333
and you're so jacked you
have muscles on your back.

79
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,792
Everyone has back muscles, Jake.

80
00:02:42,798 --> 00:02:44,747
Nuh-huh, my back looks like
the inside of a spoon.

81
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:46,415
The point is, you're
great at everything.

82
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,850
You're probably great at writing, too.

83
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:49,585
I am not showing Parlov my book, okay?

84
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,083
All right.

85
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:53,682
Here he comes. Now just drop it.

86
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:56,872
Sorry, I hope that wasn't
too tedious for you.

87
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,050
It was fascinating, especially to Terry.

88
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:00,805
- He's a writer, and he wrote a book.
- Would you read it?

89
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:03,201
- Dude!
- Sure. Love to, absolutely.

90
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:04,868
But listen, there's something
I want you to see.

91
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,407
Come with me, guys, all right?

92
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:07,808
- Jake!
- What?

93
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,689
Terry, you need to believe in yourself,

94
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,958
like when Morzak answered
the sorceress' riddle!

95
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:13,393
She turned him into a tree, Jake.

96
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:16,016
Yeah, a tree that became
the handle of Prominius' axe.

97
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:17,616
Parlov is so far away already.

98
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:19,221
Yeah, good call. Let's go after him.

99
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:20,626
Hey.

100
00:03:20,632 --> 00:03:21,832
The desk sergeant said we're hosting

101
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:23,380
a forensic sciences course.

102
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,853
Yes, taught by Dr. Ronald Yee.

103
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,842
He revolutionized the field
of forensic entomology.

104
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:30,178
He is a rock star.

105
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:32,051
Oh, please. Rock stars
wish they were he.

106
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:34,109
The man can tell how long a
corpse had been decomposing

107
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:36,082
just by studying the maggots inside.

108
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:37,584
I'd like to see Barbra
Streisand do that.

109
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:39,825
I'm not sure Barbra Streisand
counts as a rock star, sir.

110
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:41,675
She sings in English. That's rock music.

111
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,382
Well, it sounds interesting.
Can I sign up?

112
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,360
Yes, you can,

113
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:49,729
but here's the thing: if
we do well at this course,

114
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:51,464
we receive board certification,

115
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,633
which makes us eligible
to receive a grant

116
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,735
to open a field lab in the precinct,

117
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,604
but...

118
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,940
Eh... but whenever we
have a speaker come in,

119
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:02,976
you kind of tend to always

120
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,378
derail these things
with personal stories.

121
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,779
That's how I learn.
I relate course material

122
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:08,047
to my experiences.

123
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,749
Subjective learning.

124
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,069
Millennials.

125
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:12,519
I know it's important, so I promise,

126
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:13,920
I won't tell any stories,

127
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:15,655
though sometimes they do come in handy.

128
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,423
One time, all the Boyles were in

129
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,292
this fungus cavern, and this
massive mushroom comes...

130
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,760
- Charles.
- I am so sorry.

131
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,674
I slipped right into it. I'll be good.

132
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:24,998
This is my room, right over here.

133
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,633
Listen, I need just a
moment to clean up.

134
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:28,735
I had a female visitor in earlier today

135
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,003
dressed as Concubina.

136
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:33,159
She got smears of green body
paint all over everything.

137
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,475
Everything.

138
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,745
He was talking about his penis.

139
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,313
- I know, Jake.
- He pulls, Rosa.

140
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,875
- He pulls. That's all I'm saying.
- I can't believe you

141
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,851
- told him about my book.
- I'm sorry, Terry, but now

142
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:47,654
D.C. Parlov is going to read what
you wrote! How cool is that?

143
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,088
- He's pretty cool.
- Right?

144
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:50,857
You haven't even told
me what it's about yet.

145
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:52,333
Well, it's the story
of a Gorgon warrior...

146
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,124
- Awesome.
- Who betrays his bloodline...

147
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,617
- How could he?
- To marry a Cloud Princess...

148
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:57,046
- He did it for love.
- Even though

149
00:04:57,052 --> 00:04:58,383
- their families are at war.
- No! All right,

150
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,278
no more spoilers. Send it over to me,

151
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:01,578
and I'm gonna stay up
all night reading it.

152
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:03,407
- It's only 150 pages.
- I'm gonna stay up

153
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:04,779
all the next three nights reading it.

154
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,639
Dr. Yee will be here any minute,

155
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:08,363
and we need to make a good impression.

156
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,976
If you need to cough...

157
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:11,444
Cough now.

158
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:15,048
My God, what if I hadn't said anything?

159
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,516
Don't worry, I got this.

160
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:17,984
Nobody sucks up like a Boyle.

161
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,652
Our scoliosis allows us

162
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:21,352
to bow more deeply than normal people.

163
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:23,886
Huh, here's an idea: Santiago
and I will impress him

164
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:25,700
with the depth of our
forensic knowledge,

165
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:27,660
and you can wow him

166
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:30,330
with your stoic, silent demeanor.

167
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,276
No stories. Understood?

168
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:33,454
Stoic. Ah.

169
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,954
Good morning, everyone.

170
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,803
Thank you for having
me at the Nine-Nine.

171
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:38,471
Sorry I'm late. Just had to deal

172
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,906
with some family issues.

173
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:42,075
Cousins, right?

174
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,776
Okay, before we get technical,

175
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:45,378
let's talk a bit about
the history of blood.

176
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:47,413
Does anyone here know any hemophiliacs?

177
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,648
So many...

178
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,316
Now, they played a vital role

179
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:51,551
in the development of modern forensics.

180
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:53,453
Them and leeches.

181
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:54,887
My cousin Torvald is a hemophiliac,

182
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:56,689
and his wife is a leech farmer.

183
00:05:56,725 --> 00:05:58,591
I say "wife," but it's
a common-law marriage.

184
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:00,059
For the longest time,
Boyle wedding ceremonies

185
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:01,461
were not recognized in the state.

186
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:03,529
- _
- Well, here's the situation:

187
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:04,931
somebody stole my laptop,

188
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:06,833
which contained the
unpublished manuscript

189
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,968
of book 13 of "The Skyfire Cycle."

190
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:11,804
The person left this note.

191
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,506
"We have your book.

192
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,708
"Pay us $500,000 in the next 24 hours

193
00:06:15,744 --> 00:06:17,410
"or we leak it online.

194
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,045
"The first five chapters are now up."

195
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,980
They've been downloaded 85,000 times.

196
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:23,101
Well, we should probably
go online and read those

197
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:25,023
chapters in case there's
some clues in there,

198
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:27,687
and also maybe we'll find out
Qwandor's true parentage?

199
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:30,246
- Oh that's already been revealed.
- No, it hasn't.

200
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:31,724
Unless the prophecy of Dorgon

201
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,059
is indeed true!

202
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:35,795
- But that would mean...
- You seem pretty calm for somebody

203
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,036
- whose book was just stolen.
- Because I know who took it.

204
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,657
- Landon Lawson.
- He was on that panel. He writes

205
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:42,530
"The Shadowbringer Saga." It's garbage.

206
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,820
So why would Lawson want
to steal your manuscript?

207
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:46,372
We both have books coming out this fall,

208
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:47,534
and we have a rather public bet

209
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,915
about whose is going to sell better.

210
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:50,973
I believe he's leaking
my manuscript online

211
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,812
just to hurt my sales.

212
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,547
- You should arrest him.
- Well, we're not going to

213
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,015
do anything until we've
seen all the evidence.

214
00:06:56,051 --> 00:06:57,383
If this book fails,

215
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,851
that's the end of "Skyfire."

216
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:01,454
Let's go take this son of a bitch down!

217
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:03,882
Mr. Lawson? NYPD.

218
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:06,535
Let me guess: you're here
about the stolen manuscript?

219
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,332
So you admit you did it?
Well, that was easy.

220
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:11,953
What? No. Someone stole my manuscript,

221
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,545
and I know who it was:

222
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,768
D.C. Parlov.

223
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,835
By Zorton's Sword!

224
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:20,544
It's the exact same note Parlov got.

225
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,738
I don't see why anybody would
want to steal your book.

226
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:25,259
"The Skyfire Cycle" makes
"The Shadowbringer Saga"

227
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:26,797
look like "The BeastWorm Chronicles."

228
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,267
You see, Rosa, "The
BeastWorm Chronicles"

229
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:29,585
are one of the more simplistic...

230
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:30,619
- Don't care.
- Yeah.

231
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,950
You know what? My books
say something, okay?

232
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:35,522
I was the only one brave enough
to tackle elf molestation.

233
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:37,995
Guys, calm down. You're both victims.

234
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,935
Now, do you have any enemies in common?

235
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:42,229
Let me think about that.
Parlov is my enemy,

236
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:43,835
but he's also his own enemy,

237
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,737
because he's such a boring
and repetitive writer.

238
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:47,505
He just keeps killing off characters,

239
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,240
resurrecting them, and
killing 'em off again.

240
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:50,541
Because of the Chrysalis Orb!

241
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:51,676
Uh, sorry.

242
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:53,164
Police officer, on a case.

243
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,734
But we will need you to
both generate actual

244
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,303
lists of people that
might want to hurt you.

245
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,675
We have 24 hours to
figure this out, but if

246
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:59,326
we don't, are you willing
to pay the ransom?

247
00:07:59,332 --> 00:08:00,931
I'd do anything to get my book back.

248
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:02,770
I mean, you understand. You're a writer.

249
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:04,943
Do you hear that, Terry?
He called you a writer.

250
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:07,465
Terry, did you hear? Terry?

251
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:08,688
Well, Terry's broken.

252
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:10,195
Write up those lists. We're on the case.

253
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:12,562
- _
- Welcome back.

254
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:13,831
So today, I want to focus on

255
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,767
facial reconstruction.

256
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:17,602
For over a century,
we used plaster casts

257
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:20,238
to help identify decomposed
John and Jane Does.

258
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:22,707
We buried my Nana Boyle
at the family farm,

259
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:24,742
but because of the soil's
high salt content,

260
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:26,465
she turned into jerky. Never mind.

261
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:28,835
- Please continue.
- Now, I need one person per group

262
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,748
to have a plaster cast
made of their head.

263
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:32,757
Uh, will he... or she...

264
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,157
Be able to speak?

265
00:08:34,163 --> 00:08:35,553
Not while the plaster's on, no.

266
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:36,721
- I vote Charles.
- Charles.

267
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:38,077
I was gonna vote me, too.

268
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:40,258
I mean, I know the plaster
can dry out your skin,

269
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:41,859
but as a Boyle, I'm aggressively moist.

270
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:44,462
Oop, you gotta close that mouth, Boyle.

271
00:08:44,497 --> 00:08:46,057
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

272
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:48,564
Keep still and quiet.

273
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:51,736
Have you been here all night?

274
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:53,638
We traded off, and
each slept a few hours

275
00:08:53,673 --> 00:08:56,207
right here in the break
room, but we got a lead.

276
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:57,642
You know Miles Moorgil?

277
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:59,711
He wrote "The Nocturine Quartet" novels.

278
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:01,713
Well, Moorgil is the only person

279
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:05,089
on both Parlov and Lawson's
lists of potential enemies.

280
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:07,618
Apparently, they each
slept with his wife.

281
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:09,677
How do these guys do so well with women?

282
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,483
Oh, I'm sorry they don't live up to

283
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:13,291
your superficial standards
of male beauty, Rosa.

284
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:14,726
I'm kidding. It's because they're rich.

285
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,594
Moorgil's here for the conference.

286
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:19,079
We're gonna go confront him
and get the laptops back.

287
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:20,798
Then, maybe, we can see if

288
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,600
Parlov read my book yet.

289
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,635
Oh, well, I mean, it's
been less than a day.

290
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:26,404
- Maybe don't get your hopes up.
- Don't worry.

291
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:27,839
I don't have any expectations.

292
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:29,607
- Good.
- I'm gonna be at my phone,

293
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:32,243
just in case a publisher calls.
I mean, someone.

294
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:33,811
Yeah. Whatever.

295
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:35,480
It's fine. My hopes are up.

296
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:37,482
All right, buddy.

297
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:39,183
I couldn't sleep last
night, so I started

298
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:41,152
reading Terry's book, and it's terrible.

299
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:43,321
I made him show it to Parlov.
He's gonna be humiliated.

300
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:44,889
Relax. How bad could it be?

301
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:46,791
So bad, and I'm entertained
by everything.

302
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:48,240
I once went to a play.

303
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:49,527
So what are you gonna do about Parlov?

304
00:09:49,562 --> 00:09:51,162
- I don't know.
- Don't know what?

305
00:09:51,197 --> 00:09:52,330
Uh, how to do...

306
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:53,878
Sex... good.

307
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,900
How much should I be
flapping my arms around?

308
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:56,973
- Not much.
- Right.

309
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,569
Well, that settles that.

310
00:09:58,605 --> 00:10:00,538
I knew that Amy was wrong.

311
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:02,206
Anyways, let's get back
on the case, right?

312
00:10:02,242 --> 00:10:03,839
Skyfire Cycle.

313
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,477
Okay, now that the plaster's dry,

314
00:10:06,513 --> 00:10:08,081
you'll see why we lubricated the

315
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,899
subject's face with Vaseline first.

316
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:12,315
Oh, no, we forgot the lube.

317
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:14,867
Charles, can you hear us?

318
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,373
What do we do?

319
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,557
Doctor? Uh, what if someone...

320
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:21,392
No one in this room, mind you...

321
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:23,537
Forgot to lubricate before
applying the plaster?

322
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:25,797
Oh, one of my lab techs
made that mistake once.

323
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,665
It becomes impossible to remove the mask

324
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,500
without literally skinning
the subject alive.

325
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:31,067
It takes five days for the plaster

326
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:32,294
to slough off on its own.

327
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,720
And what became of the lab tech?

328
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:35,014
Oh, I fired him. It was an

329
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,547
unacceptable level of incompetence.

330
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,943
Huh, what a satisfying
conclusion to that story.

331
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:40,178
- Boyle!
- Mm.

332
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,370
A mistake was made and we

333
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:42,712
can't remove your mask yet.

334
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:44,348
We're gonna leave you in here...

335
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:45,817
Until after the class is over,

336
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:47,585
because if Dr. Yee sees you like this,

337
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,754
we can kiss our certification good-bye.

338
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:52,256
I'm sorry, Boyle,

339
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:53,458
but Hitchcock and Scully

340
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:54,692
will be here with you.

341
00:10:57,315 --> 00:10:58,863
I don't know, Captain.
He seems pretty upset.

342
00:10:58,898 --> 00:11:00,731
- Hold on.
- Mm!

343
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:05,503
Look how happy he is now.

344
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:08,739
Yes, you're welcome, Boyle.

345
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:10,374
I don't understand.

346
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,410
Why do you think I would
steal those laptops?

347
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:14,378
Parlov and Lawson are your rivals.

348
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:15,880
You're jealous of their success.

349
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:17,648
And of course, you have
a personal motive.

350
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:19,892
You hate them for
sleeping with your wife.

351
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:22,588
- What? They slept with my wife?
- And you didn't know.

352
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,356
Well, this is awkward. We
should probably just go.

353
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:26,657
- Jessica!
- She's here.

354
00:11:26,693 --> 00:11:28,459
- That's wonderful.
- Yes, sweets?

355
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:29,931
Did you sleep with D.C.

356
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:31,623
Parlov and Landon Lawson?

357
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:34,332
- Uh...
- Why would you do that?

358
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,208
You've ruined our marriage.
You've ruined it!

359
00:11:36,214 --> 00:11:37,337
You know, this seems like a

360
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,674
conversation for just you two,

361
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:40,238
so... oop, here comes a child.

362
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:41,519
Mommy? Daddy?

363
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:43,341
Are you getting divorced?

364
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:44,996
Are they getting divorced?

365
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:47,512
Uh...

366
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:48,913
Oof.

367
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,281
Okay, that was a rough 70 minutes.

368
00:11:50,316 --> 00:11:52,717
- Yeah, but...
- That kid looked exactly like Parlov?

369
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:53,784
100%.

370
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,386
Oh...

371
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:57,321
Anyways, that was our last lead,

372
00:11:57,357 --> 00:11:59,757
so looks like we're back
at the Nil Caverns.

373
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,810
- Did you just say the Nil Caverns?
- Hm?

374
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:04,923
- Like, from my book?
- Uh, yep.

375
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:06,140
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, I did,

376
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:07,436
because you told me about them

377
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:08,863
when you were explaining the plot.

378
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:10,501
I didn't, but that's because I wanted

379
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:12,050
the Nil Caverns to be a surprise.

380
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:14,639
Why didn't you tell me
you read my book, Jake?

381
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,173
- Uh...
- Oh, no.

382
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:17,341
- You hated it.
- What?

383
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:19,877
Terry, no, I didn't hate it.

384
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:22,306
- I liked tons of parts.
- Name one.

385
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:24,749
Name one part you liked, Jake.

386
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,218
- The map?
- I didn't draw that!

387
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:28,653
It was a map of the Chesapeake Bay

388
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:30,288
with the names slightly changed!

389
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:32,790
Oh, my God.

390
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:34,692
You made me show Parlov.

391
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:37,543
You humiliated me in front of my hero!

392
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:40,264
Sarge, I'm sorry.

393
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,499
Look, I didn't just like the map.

394
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:42,800
I also liked...

395
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:44,454
the spaces between the words!

396
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,759
That's not helpful.

397
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,636
You guys got a million dollars

398
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,115
together on 24 hours' notice?

399
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:52,035
Yeah, I had to liquidate my Bitcoins.

400
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,380
Oh, really?

401
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,053
I would've thought you'd
be flushed with cash

402
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:56,904
from the "Skyfire" TV series.

403
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,075
Oh, wait, that's right.

404
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,544
The CW passed.

405
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,479
How's the "Shadowbringer"
film coming along?

406
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,381
Howie Long still playing both twins?

407
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,800
All right. Let's go over the plan.

408
00:13:04,806 --> 00:13:07,318
Okay, there's a potted tree on
the east side of the lobby.

409
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,120
They said to leave the
briefcase behind that.

410
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,055
If someone grabs it,
Rosa, Peralta, and I

411
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,490
will converge. We'll be positioned

412
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,103
around the room in disguise.

413
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:16,059
It's not gonna work. I
don't own a nerd costume.

414
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:19,205
Oh, but Rosa, you are
already wearing one.

415
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,812
You naturally dress like
the female bounty hunter

416
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:23,531
in every steampunk novel.

417
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,172
Look. All you need are welding goggles.

418
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:28,474
Damn it.

419
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,074
I have welding goggles in the car.

420
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,109
Shall we to battle?

421
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,940
To solve that problem, we would

422
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:44,522
use fluid dynamic analysis.

423
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:47,262
That is exactly right. Well done.

424
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,900
Where's your friend?

425
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:50,384
Shouldn't he be here for
the plaster removal?

426
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,422
Something came up, so he
had to remove the mask,

427
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:54,895
which came off quite
easily, and run out.

428
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,334
It was urgent police business.

429
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,902
Bunch of kids are being held hostage,

430
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,136
so he had to go deal with that.

431
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,223
Oh, well, if you need to leave
to provide him with backup...

432
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:02,659
- No, it's a teachable moment.
- The children

433
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:04,225
- can handle themselves.
- Captain Holt?

434
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:05,590
Your husband's on the phone.

435
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,128
He wants to know how long

436
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:09,008
you're going to kiss for tonight?

437
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,148
Would you excuse us for one moment?

438
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,461
Your husband didn't really call.

439
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:15,900
I wasn't sure what gay guys talk about

440
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:17,320
on the phone. How'd I do?

441
00:14:17,326 --> 00:14:18,895
Scully, what do you want?

442
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,472
We were watching Charles, like you said,

443
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:22,859
but both of us had to go to
the bathroom really bad.

444
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:24,431
Ugh. Where's Charles?

445
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,363
- We have no idea.
- What?

446
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:28,339
- Terry, do you copy?
- I copy.

447
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:31,090
- Seriously? You're still mad at me?
- All I said was "I copy."

448
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:33,315
Yeah, but you had a tone. Just admit it.

449
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,138
- Let it go, Jake.
- No, he's right.

450
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:36,258
Terry had a tone.

451
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:38,512
- Terry had a big-time tone.
- Don't worry.

452
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:40,013
I bet he hasn't even read your book yet.

453
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,104
It's been two hours. I'm almost
at the front of this line.

454
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,308
I don't even know who I'm
waiting to take a picture with.

455
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:46,222
"Bran Stark?" Pass.

456
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:49,129
Okay, he's just the three-eyed raven.

457
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:50,935
Here we go, here we go. We got action.

458
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:52,841
He dresses just like you, Jake.
Is that someone popular?

459
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:54,653
Yes, Rosa, it's Ka'lar.

460
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:57,055
17th of his name, sworn
knight of the Queen's Crown,

461
00:14:57,091 --> 00:14:58,536
the Daybreaker, the rightful heir to...

462
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:00,269
All right. You can just say "Ka'lar."

463
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,290
Uh, then how will you know which
Ka'lar I'm talking about?

464
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:03,628
It's a very common name in "Skyfire."

465
00:15:03,664 --> 00:15:05,097
It's like their John.

466
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:07,099
He's going for the briefcase.

467
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:08,715
Okay, let's go.

468
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,168
Don't make your move
until you're close to him.

469
00:15:10,204 --> 00:15:11,970
There's too many civilians.

470
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:16,908
Wait, why are there so many Ka'lars?

471
00:15:16,944 --> 00:15:18,503
Costume contest just ended.

472
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:20,712
That's why he waited until
now to pick up the money.

473
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:22,314
I lost him. Which one is it?

474
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:23,748
It's the one headed toward
the service elevator.

475
00:15:23,784 --> 00:15:25,050
Hey! Freeze!

476
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:26,490
NYPD. Let me see your hands.

477
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:28,086
What's going on?

478
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:30,594
Doesn't have the briefcase.
I got the wrong Ka'lar.

479
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,224
- I have eyes on him.
- Take him down!

480
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:36,785
Wrong Ka'lar...

481
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:39,631
Boyle's not in the interrogation room.

482
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,266
He couldn't have gotten far.
He can't see.

483
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,201
You can go a long way
on muscle memory alone.

484
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,803
One time, I sleepwalked

485
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:47,213
- to the M&M's store in Times Square.
- Oh, oh!

486
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,016
Stairwell.

487
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:51,593
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
- I'm okay.

488
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:54,045
It's okay. Sorry, stranger.

489
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,680
I just can't see anything at all,

490
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:57,616
and it's really scary being touched.

491
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:59,117
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

492
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:00,752
Just return me to the 99th precinct.

493
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:02,287
Boyle, it's us.

494
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:04,156
Where were you going?
Why would you leave

495
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:05,924
that windowless supply
closet we locked you in?

496
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,193
Ah, yes, hearing it, I understand why.

497
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:09,828
I was trying to get to the locker room

498
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,229
to steam the mask off in the shower

499
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:13,298
so you guys could still get certified.

500
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,475
Wait.

501
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:16,415
You were trying to help us?

502
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:18,303
Even though you'll be stuck
in this mask for five days?

503
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:19,792
Five days?

504
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:21,935
Well, I know how important
the course was to you.

505
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:23,975
It's not.

506
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:26,077
Not anymore.

507
00:16:26,113 --> 00:16:27,779
I'm so sorry.

508
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:30,215
I just cannot see at all.

509
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,616
I can't believe it!

510
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:33,718
Now I'm out $1/2 million!

511
00:16:33,754 --> 00:16:35,187
What am I supposed to do now?

512
00:16:35,222 --> 00:16:37,022
Write another "Compendium of Beasts"?

513
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:38,890
Do you have any idea how hard it is

514
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:42,594
to find enough interns to
slap that crap together?

515
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:43,806
God!

516
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:45,096
Don't worry about him.

517
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:46,998
At least we got to stop that thief

518
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:48,833
from releasing any more chapters.

519
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:50,369
All we're out is some
money, plus I've got

520
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,908
insurance, so I'm going
to get it all back.

521
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:53,198
By the way, Detective Jeffords,

522
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:54,353
while we were waiting,

523
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,007
I had an opportunity to
read your manuscript.

524
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:58,043
Oh, don't worry about that.

525
00:16:58,078 --> 00:16:59,878
It's a work in progress.

526
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:01,279
Has a lot of changes I...

527
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:03,048
No, no, no, it was great. Truly.

528
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,150
Fantastic. I mean, it
was so fresh, you know?

529
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:07,052
It had a really unique point of view.

530
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:08,753
I sent it on to my publishers.

531
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,528
Thank you for allowing me to read it.

532
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:11,756
And I want to thank you all

533
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,725
for your hard, hard work on this case.

534
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,126
Appreciate it.

535
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,230
Ooh, did you hear that?

536
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:19,631
He loved it.

537
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,033
D.C. Parlov loved my writing!

538
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,635
You were wrong!

539
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,637
And being wrong never felt so right.

540
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:27,801
Oh, that sounded cool. Did
I just make up a hit song?

541
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,908
♪ Being wrong never felt so right ♪

542
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:32,077

543
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:33,645
Yep, I was right. It's a hit.

544
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,976
I gotta go call Sharon!

545
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:37,011
All righty. Well,
congratulations, Sarge!

546
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:38,283
And don't forget about us

547
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,884
when you become a famous author.

548
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,853
Terry's writing sucks.
Parlov is lying to him.

549
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:44,556
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

550
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:46,291
He's buttering him up...

551
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,193
because Lawson and Parlov

552
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:50,562
stole their own books!

553
00:17:50,597 --> 00:17:51,830

00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:02,878
Okay, we should go.

560
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:05,382
Why do you think these
guys are in it together?

561
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:07,121
They hate each other. They spent an hour

562
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:08,851
arguing over the name of the
dragon in "The Hobbit."

563
00:18:08,857 --> 00:18:10,323
- "Smog."
- "Smowg."

564
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,091
- Smog!
- Smowg!

565
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:13,793
- Smog!
- Smowg!

566
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:15,870
It's "Smowg," by the way...

567
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:18,577
Point Lawson... but yes,
they're mortal enemies,

568
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:20,011
which is why they think
we'll never suspect them

569
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:21,346
of being in cahoots.

570
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:22,948
Oh, but they cahooted, Rosa.

571
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:25,450
They cahooted all over us.

572
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:26,952
Gross. Why'd they leak their chapters?

573
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:28,651
To get people excited, like when Carly

574
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:29,932
Rae Jepsen puts out an amazing single,

575
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:32,047
and you have to wait six weeks
for the album to come out.

576
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:33,377
She's great. I'm not apologizing.

577
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:35,356
So Parlov contacted
Terry because he knows

578
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,247
Sarge is a super-fan and
can be manipulated.

579
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,640
Yes, he's been giving Terry
presents since last year.

580
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:40,836
And Terry's novel gave Parlov

581
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:42,272
another chance to manipulate him.

582
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:43,386
Unless...

583
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,655
is it possible Parlov actually
likes Sarge's writing?

584
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,657
Read the first sentence.

585
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:49,890
- Yep, Parlov did it.
- Very much so.

586
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,663
Gah! Now I have to tell Sarge

587
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,803
that his fantasy novel stinks.

588
00:18:53,838 --> 00:18:56,605
This is the hardest part of being a cop.

589
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:58,874
Now, there are issues with RFLP testing,

590
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,010
as there are with every
technique, but...

591
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:02,778
Captain, I thought you said

592
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:04,680
your friend removed his mask and left.

593
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:06,749
I forgot to lube up his face.

594
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,751
We failed to listen to the instructions.

595
00:19:08,786 --> 00:19:10,468
That is incredibly careless.

596
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:12,058
I know, and it means we won't receive

597
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:13,989
our certification, and
I'm okay with that.

598
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:16,025
- Unless my honesty...
- No, it's off the table.

599
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,929
- And I'm okay with that.
- Well, anyway, RFLP testing

600
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:21,897
was designed to localize
genetic disorders, and it...

601
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:24,724
Ooh, my cousin Donna
has a genetic disorder

602
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,702
where her lips were made of cartilage,

603
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:28,771
meaning her mouth is technically a beak.

604
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:30,439
I don't see how that
pertains to anything...

605
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:31,941
No, let him talk. I want to hear it.

606
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:33,976
Boyle, tell us about your cousin's beak.

607
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:36,011
Well, she runs marathons

608
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:37,718
to raise money for other people

609
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:39,286
afflicted with "bird-face."

610
00:19:39,317 --> 00:19:40,483
There are only two of them.

611
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:42,785
- They're her kids.
- Oh, Sarge!

612
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,223
Funny seeing you here.

613
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:45,855
Oh, that reminds me.

614
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,756
I have to tell you something.
What was it?

615
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:49,024
Out with it, Peralta.

616
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,726
Okay, fine. Here it goes.

617
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:52,795
- I think that...
- Parlov hated my book.

618
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,464
He only said he liked it
so I wouldn't figure out

619
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,700
he and Lawson stole
their own manuscripts.

620
00:19:57,735 --> 00:19:59,584
- You figured it out.
- Well, I had a gut feeling,

621
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,707
so I went digging.

622
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:02,734
I got a warrant for
Parlov's browser history.

623
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,773
He searched "how to liquidate Bitcoins"

624
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:06,679
three days before the
laptops were stolen.

625
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,677
Man, I bet that browser
history was a nightmare, huh?

626
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:10,354
- Oh, you have no idea.
- Yeah.

627
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,481
Anyway, I questioned them,
and they confessed.

628
00:20:12,517 --> 00:20:13,983
I can't go to prison, okay?

629
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:16,352
I know I seem tough, but I'm not.

630
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:17,946
- I went to Bennington.
- Ew.

631
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:19,889
I'm sorry Parlov didn't like your book.

632
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:21,524
And I didn't. And also Rosa.

633
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,425
- Why did I add that?
- No, it's okay.

634
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:25,732
At least I won't waste any more
time trying to be a writer.

635
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:27,371
Wait, let me ask you a question.

636
00:20:27,524 --> 00:20:29,331
Are you a better cop now
than when you started?

637
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,567
- Nope.
- Wasn't talking to you.

638
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:33,936
Yeah. I look back at my old cases

639
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:35,804
and I can't believe how long

640
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,244
- it took me to figure things out.
- Yeah, but you worked on it,

641
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,708
and you kept working, and now,

642
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:41,911
12 to 40 years later...

643
00:20:41,946 --> 00:20:43,546
I don't have a good sense of your age...

644
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:45,314
You're a great cop who
got a "gut feeling"

645
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,815
and solved a huge case.

646
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:48,584
So you think I should keep writing?

647
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,486
I mean, you might not become
a huge famous author,

648
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:51,987
but you'll get better,

649
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:54,221
and if it makes you happy,
it can't be that bad.

650
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:56,321
Sheryl Crow, she's great.
I won't apologize.

651
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:57,960
And who knows? Claire Essalgorn

652
00:20:57,995 --> 00:20:59,695
didn't start writing the
first "Crimson Portal" novel

653
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,797
until she was 60.

654
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:03,933
I started reading it because
the character looks like me.

655
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:06,001
I kept reading it because it's so good!

656
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:08,337
Rosa, you did get hooked, you big nerd!

657
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:09,605
This heroine is my heroin.

658
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,440
Oh, such a dweebus. I love it!

659
00:21:11,475 --> 00:21:13,809
Speaking of which, Parlov's
laptop is in evidence.

660
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:15,474
Want to go read the new "Skyfire" book?

661
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,012
Oh, I don't know.

662
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:18,981
I mean, he's such a bad guy.

663
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:20,716
Do we even like his books anymore?

664
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,852

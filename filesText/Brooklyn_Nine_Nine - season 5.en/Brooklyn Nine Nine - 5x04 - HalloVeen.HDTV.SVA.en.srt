1
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:06,661
Halloween. Mua-ha-ha-ha.

2
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,602
It's heist time.

3
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:11,204
- Dah!
- Thought you could get

4
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:12,806
a head start on heist prep? Good luck.

5
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:14,074
I'm already dressed.

6
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:16,443
Well... I'm also dressed,

7
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:19,079
and I made breakfast.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,082
- Wait, where are my eggs?
- In my belly.

9
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,783
Now get a move on.

10
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:25,151
It's heist time.

11
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:26,986
I love Halloween!

12

13
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,976
Some of you have asked me
what got me through prison.

14
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:52,166
Was it my family? Don't be stupid.

15
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:54,749
Was it knowing that my friends
would eventually get me out?

16
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,816
Of course not, I never
believed in any of you.

17
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:58,351
No, the only thing that kept me sane

18
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:00,120
was planning for the Halloween heist

19
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:02,106
those many years doing hard time.

20
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:04,239
- It was eight weeks.
- I also went to prison, dog.

21
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:06,327
- We're getting off track here.
- No, we're not, dog.

22
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,194
Peralta's just trying to
play the sympathy card

23
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:09,529
so we all go easy on him.

24
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,197
I'd rather send you back to prison

25
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:13,333
- than see you win.
- Okay.

26
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,401
This year, we compete for
the most elegant and regal

27
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:17,103
of all prizes...

28
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:18,938
A championship cummerbund.

29
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:20,573
Or belt, as normal people call it.

30
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:22,409
Belt... I'd like to
see the pair of slacks

31
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,310
whose loops are large
enough for this belt.

32
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:26,279
No, it is a cummerbund.

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,148
- Well, whatever it is...
- Cummerbund.

34
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:30,450
It's inscribed with the words,
"Amazing human/genius."

35
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:33,119
The objective is to have it in
your possession at midnight.

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,888
This year, the competition
is not limited

37
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:36,795
- to winners of the past heists.
- That's right.

38
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:38,191
Any man, or woman...

39
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:40,093
#Resist... can enter.

40
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:42,328
- It's open to everyone.
- Ooh, every man for himself.

41
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,010
It's like "Bachelor in Paradise."

42
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:46,145
It's really cool that you
guys opened it up to anyone.

43
00:01:46,152 --> 00:01:47,555
Thanks. Yeah, we talked about it,

44
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:48,935
and we just felt like it was only fair.

45
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,423
I was being sarcastic. You all suck,

46
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:51,820
and I hope Jake goes back to jail.

47
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:54,371
Oh, cool, I'm glad everyone feels
comfortable joking about that.

48
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:55,932
- Not joking.
- Insult me all you want,

49
00:01:55,938 --> 00:01:57,277
for I have only this to say...

50
00:01:57,278 --> 00:01:59,162
Victory shall be mine!

51
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:01,933
I heard you practicing in the shower.
You can't surprise me.

52
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,425
Letting me into your life was
the worst mistake you ever made.

53
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:06,054
Cool, fun take on our relationship.

54
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,876
Well, I for one thing you're
perfect for each other...

55
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:09,185
Feel like there's gonna be more.

56
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:11,096
- Because you're both losers.
- There it is.

57
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:14,022
None of you stand a chance against me.
No courage, no patience,

58
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:15,109
no brains,

59
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:18,198
and, of course, a bald old man.

60
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,264
I'm younger than you.

61
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,100
No comeback for the bald thing, I see.

62
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:22,802
Yeah, I'm not doing the heist. I'm out.

63
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:24,137
Okay.

64
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:25,572
- Bull crap.
- Yeah, right.

65
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:27,407
Just like you were out last year.

66
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:29,943
- I was out last year.
- As a setup for this year.

67
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:31,978
You're good, Jeffords,
but not good enough.

68
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,681
In fact, you're an idiot.
I should've fired you long ago.

69
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:36,449
- What?
- Relax, Terry, chill out.

70
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,884
Get your undies out of your buns.

71
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:39,953
Now, if everyone would rise.

72
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:42,255
Rise like the army of the dead,

73
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:46,125
and follow me into the
bullpen of destiny.

74
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:47,794
This heist,

75
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:49,662
the belt will not be
locked up or hidden away.

76
00:02:49,663 --> 00:02:52,232
It will be suspended from
the ceiling in plain sight

77
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,100
- for all to see.
- How poetic.

78
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:55,802
It will hang just out of reach,

79
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:57,503
like Tantalus's fruit.

80
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,739
Yes, that's where I got
the inspiration from,

81
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,742
Greek mythology, not an episode
of the Nickelodeon show "Guts."

82
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:04,383
Amy, will you please do the honors?

83
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,678
Mm-hmm.

84
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:11,226
- The belt is in place.
- Whoever has it at midnight

85
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,161
will be declared the...

86
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,254
What's going on?

87
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:15,788
- What's happening?
- I can't see!

88
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,443
Everybody just grab something random.

89
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:18,625
Back off, Hitchcock.

90
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:20,059
Silence!

91
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,228
It's gone. The cummerbund is gone!

92
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:24,464
Who took it? We're all here.
Where'd it go?

93
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:26,900
Nowhere. It's still in this room.

94
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:30,737
In fact, it's right here!

95
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:32,472
Nope, it's just your tum-tum.

96
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:36,442
I don't have the cummerbund,
because it's right here!

97
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:39,746
Or is it right here?

98
00:03:39,747 --> 00:03:41,180
Everybody stop undressing.

99
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,815
We just had harassment training.

100
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:45,752
<i>Hey... over here, losers.</i>

101
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:47,335
<i>This is Gina Linetti.</i>

102
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:49,322
<i>You really thought you
could do this without me?</i>

103
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:51,157
<i>I'm the defending champion.</i>

104
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:53,826
Gina... I should have known
it was you, you punk.

105
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:55,428
Yeah, you punk,

106
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:57,305
why aren't you showing
your face, you punk?

107
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,665
<i>Yeah, I just had a baby.</i>

108
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,524
<i>I haven't washed my hair in three weeks.</i>

109
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,901
Oh, how is she?

110
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:04,043
- Yeah, how's she doing?
<i>- None of your business.</i>

111
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:06,039
<i>Now, if you wanna find the belt,</i>

112
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,874
<i>you're gonna have to work for it.</i>

113
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,043
<i>Behind my desk are boxes of baby stuff</i>

114
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:11,945
<i>that I didn't wanna assemble.</i>

115
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:14,414
<i>You get a clue for each
item you put together.</i>

116
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:16,749
<i>Linetti, Lin-out-ti.</i>

117
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,284
This is crazy.

118
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:21,154
I mean, no one is actually gonna
do Gina's dumb chores, right?

119
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:22,555
Right, absolutely not.

120
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:24,091
It's completely ridiculous.

121
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,529
I got the reach-and-play!

122
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,331
You can all suck it!

123
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:40,421
- They fell for it.
- Hook, line, and sphincter.

124
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:42,595
- It's sinker.
- No, it's sphincter.

125
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:44,697
That's where you put the
hook in when you're eeling.

126
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:46,432
Well, I never use that expression again.

127
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,967
- Hey, guys.
- Ah.

128
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:50,736
- And right on time, here's Bill.
- Welcome.

129
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:53,272
Man, it is amazing how
similar you guys look.

130
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:54,774
- I don't see it.
- Me neither.

131
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,242
- Not even a little.
- Not at all.

132
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:58,010
Twins. So, did you have any issues

133
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:00,046
- getting into the vents?
- Went like clockwork.

134
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:02,415
Sir, only authorized personnel
are allowed up here.

135
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,383
Oh, Detective Boyle,
didn't see it was you.

136
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:06,752
Get better eyes, you moron.

137
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:09,188
Ah, man, I'm friends with Officer Lou.

138
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,999
Not anymore. He was very upset.

139
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:13,226
Anyway, once I got in the vents,
it was smooth sailing.

140
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:15,194
The belt is in place.

141
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:17,671
Whoever has it at midnight
will be declared the winner

142
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:19,572
of the fifth annual...

143
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:21,070
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

144
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:23,153
I can't see! Everyone just
grab something randomly.

145
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,761
Back off, Hitchcock.

146
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,910
Hey, over here, losers.

147
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:33,112
I gotta say, Bill,
your Gina impression was spot-on.

148
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:34,312
I'm very good at roleplay,

149
00:05:34,318 --> 00:05:36,059
and I'm super comfortable wearing masks.

150
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:38,005
Right, I forgot you were
maybe a male prostitute.

151
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:39,419
I was definitely a male prostitute,

152
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,920
but I don't do that profession anymore.

153
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:42,622
Now I sell vitamin supplements.

154
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:44,891
I made $90,000 this year alone,

155
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:46,792
working out of the
comfort of my own home.

156
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:47,894
- Uh-huh?
- How did I do it?

157
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:49,105
- NutriBoom.
- Right.

158
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:50,726
And the good news is, you can do it too.

159
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:53,255
Okay, this is clearly a pyramid
scheme. We're not interested.

160
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:54,567
Okay, your loss.

161
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:56,502
- Here's the belt...
- Ah...

162
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:58,671
- she's a beauty.
- Hi-yah!

163
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:00,572
Ow! Charles, what are you doing?

164
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:02,561
The hardest thing I've
EVER DONE: betraying you.

165
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,043
Bill, the belt.

166
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:05,519
- Bill, you're in on this too?
- Yep.

167
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,339
Charles promised he'd
buy a ton of supplements

168
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:09,113
and become one of my
downstream distributors.

169
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,855
No, look, listen to me,
don't do this, okay?

170
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:12,932
I really need to win this year.
I'm begging you.

171
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,082
Those baby browns aren't
gonna work on me, not today.

172
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,187
This is crazy.

173
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:18,090
You're never gonna get out of
here with that belt on your own.

174
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,059
I'm not on my own. I have an alliance.

175
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:23,262
An alliance.

176
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:25,598
It's not "Bachelor in
Paradise." It's "Survivor."

177
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,437
Rosa, I am very disappointed in you.

178
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:28,885
Your approval means nothing to me.

179
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:31,103
Copy that. And Terry,
I knew you were playing.

180
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,239
- Last year was a setup.
- Hell yeah, it was.

181
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,241
I'm sick of you, Amy, and Holt winning.

182
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:37,777
- You're all so damn smug.
- Yeah, you guys may be champs,

183
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:40,912
but this year... this year
belongs to The Tramps.

184
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,134
- Charles, that's a bad name.
- Ha, you're just jealous.

185
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:44,550
- Everyone loves it.
- No.

186
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:46,446
- Nuh-uh.
- Bill, keep an eye on him.

187
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:49,589
Let's go, Tramps. Charles, no! No!

188
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:52,193
Hey, let me ask you this,
how would you like to be your own boss?

189
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,201
Not now, Bill!

190
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:56,998
Amy! Amy, in here!

191
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,124
In here. Help.

192
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:02,078
- Hello, fake Charles.
- Hi.

193
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:03,406
Hello, tied-up Jake.

194
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:05,062
Will you please help me get out of this?

195
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:07,031
It's not for the heist.
I just really have to pee.

196
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,929
I know you don't drink water.
You pee once every two days.

197
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:12,337
- And you went this morning.
- Damn it, you know me so well.

198
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,407
All right, how about this?

199
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:16,488
I've got top secret info
about various dealings.

200
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:17,815
If you let me out of these cuffs,

201
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:19,917
- I'll share it with you.
- What kind of info?

202
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:21,952
Well, first off, Wolf Gina...

203
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:24,488
Was just a ruse so you and
Charles could steal the belt.

204
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:26,524
Yeah-huh, but also...

205
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,993
Charles teamed up with Rosa
and Terry to form The Tramps.

206
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:30,361
Gah! How did you know that?

207
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:31,862
I gave Charles the idea last year.

208
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:35,065
Gina's one of the champs.

209
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:37,234
And I'm just one of the tramps.

210
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:39,437
Ooh, The Tramps.

211
00:07:39,438 --> 00:07:41,705
That's a great name for something.

212
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:44,775
I just don't know what.

213
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:46,444
But I do.

214
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,846
I told you, I'll always
be one step ahead of you.

215
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:51,393
You can't surprise me. Ya boring.

216
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,196
You know what spices up a relationship?

217
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:54,888
Co-owning a multi-tiered marketing...

218
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:56,546
Ignore him. Look,
there are three Tramps.

219
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:58,367
The only way we're gonna
win is if we team up.

220
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:01,025
Good point. I guess my response is,

221
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:03,513
rot in hell, crap-face!

222
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,170
Also, I love you, and I treasure you,

223
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,698
- and ya bore me.
- God, you're being so mean.

224
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:09,951
- Do it more.
- I hope you die.

225
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,635
Bye.

226
00:08:11,636 --> 00:08:15,306
Fine! Go! Who needs you,
ya freakin' jag!

227
00:08:15,307 --> 00:08:17,769
Looks like we're all clear.
Good job, guys.

228
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:20,177
Oh, nothing can stop this Tramp train.

229
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:22,713
Boyle, stop finding
variations on a word we hate.

230
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:24,711
Okay, Sarge, lift up
the super heavy thing

231
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:26,654
that no one else is
strong enough to lift.

232
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,557
Nice, Sarge! Keep lifting
heavy stuff like that,

233
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:35,914
and maybe you'll work off
some of that bulk, huh?

234
00:08:35,921 --> 00:08:38,378
- What?
- I set up an electric eye yesterday,

235
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,425
so if anyone enters this room,
an alarm will go off.

236
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's move. Don't cross the beam.

237
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:52,710
Cool, yeah, that's something I
can do, without any problem.

238
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:56,380
Alarm works.

239
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:59,245
All right, fine,

240
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:01,435
looks like I'm gonna have
to "127 Hours" this sitch.

241
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:03,765
- You're gonna cut off your own arm?
- Is that how it ends?

242
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:05,796
Oh, man, I got busy,
and my rental period expired.

243
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:08,599
I thought he just wiggled out.
Come, will you just please un-cuff me?

244
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:09,693
Please, you gotta, man.

245
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:11,595
I've never treated you
like a prostitute.

246
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:14,175
- You just did.
- Touché.

247
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:16,103
All right, how about this? I will buy...

248
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,089
double the amount of
supplements that Boyle did.

249
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:20,815
- $8,000?
- What? He gave you 4 grand?

250
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:22,875
All right, fine, I'm in.

251
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:25,642
He didn't give it to me.
He invested it in his future.

252
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,629
- And you can too.
- Yeah, I already agreed to it.

253
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:30,317
- You don't have to keep selling me.
- Sorry, the script we're given

254
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:31,800
anticipates a lot more resistance.

255
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:33,447
Okay, so let's get the
paperwork started.

256
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:35,227
First things first, you are not allowed

257
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:37,022
to have any of this
reviewed by an attorney.

258
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,137
Yeah, this seems bad.

259
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,557
So, where on Gina's mobile

260
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:41,559
should I place this moonless Jupiter?

261
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,228
I pity the child who lies
beneath this solar system.

262
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:46,730
Hey, Captain, something's
going on with this heist.

263
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:48,332
You tell us everything you know,

264
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,393
and we'll tell you everything we know.

265
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,343
- I'd rather not.
- Jokes on you,

266
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,560
- we don't know anything.
- Well, good day then.

267
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:57,088
- Wait, why are you sweating?
- I'm not sweating.

268
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,503
No, I've had enough heart attacks

269
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,917
to know what sweating looks
like, and that's sweat.

270
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:07,017
Well, if I'm sweating, as you claim,

271
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:10,345
it's because I was watching
an exciting video on the net.

272
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:11,656
<i>Really? What?</i>

273
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:14,359
It was a video of an American gymnast.

274
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:17,228
His leotard ripped, exposing his butt.

275
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:19,695
- It was highly erotic.
- You're lying.

276
00:10:19,696 --> 00:10:22,131
I.T. just installed blocker software,

277
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:24,099
<i>- thanks to moi.
- Uh, yes,</i>

278
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,235
but they didn't install
it on my computer,

279
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:27,751
because I'm a captain.

280
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:29,691
You don't look hot and
bothered at all to me.

281
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:31,407
- Show us the erotica.
- Gentlemen,

282
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:33,209
<i>I assure you, there's nothing to see.</i>

283
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,178
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to grab some fresh air.

284
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:46,954
Good boy, Cheddar.
Bring me that cummerbund.

285
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:50,065
Oh, yeah.

286
00:10:50,227 --> 00:10:52,061
Wait a minute...

287
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:54,263
this isn't the championship cummerbund.

288
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:57,199
This is some common cummerbund.

289
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,272
And you're not Cheddar.
You're just some common bitch.

290
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,304
And this says you've received
your sales training.

291
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,206
- Great.
- And this one is

292
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:06,698
a sworn affidavit stating that
you have seen Debbie Stovelman,

293
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:08,700
the wife of NutriBoom founder,
David Stovelman,

294
00:11:08,707 --> 00:11:10,898
and that you found her to be
happy, healthy, and alive.

295
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:12,405
Okay, fine. Great, all right, done.

296
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:13,850
Just get me out of these.

297
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:18,687
Hey, what's going on here?

298
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,226
Yeah! Didn't think I could get
out of my cuffs, did you, Boyle?

299
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:26,295
But you forgot about
one important thing...

300
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:29,131
- NutriBoom.
- NutriBoom! That's right.

301
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:31,133
I'm in the President's Circle now.

302
00:11:31,134 --> 00:11:33,502
Sorry, Charles, this year's
heist was just too important.

303
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,205
- Watch him, Bill.
<i>- Check in, Boyle, check in.</i>

304
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:38,474
Uh-oh, Jake, they check
in every ten minutes,

305
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:42,646
and I have to respond
with a code only we know.

306
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:46,423
- I am a Tramp.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

307
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,963
Did I guess it? Did I guess the code?

308
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,496
I couldn't hear what Rosa said
back, but was that right?

309
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:52,138
- You got it.
- Yeah, I thought so, okay.

310
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:55,357
Okay, security system, talk to me.

311
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:57,459
What have I missed? What's going on?

312
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,462
Ah-ha! Holt used Cheddar
to steal the belt.

313
00:12:00,463 --> 00:12:01,936
But that's not Cheddar.

314
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:03,960
Holt and Cheddar always
walk in a perfect lockstep.

315
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,334
Which means someone took Cheddar,

316
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:06,969
and that person has the belt.

317
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,340
But who? Who took Cheddar?

318
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:13,475
- Where are you coming from?
- Why do you care?

319
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:15,444
- Thought you weren't heisting.
- I'm not.

320
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:17,346
I'm just interested in
your comings and goings,

321
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:19,240
because I care about you as a friend.

322
00:12:19,247 --> 00:12:20,977
Okay, friend, I went to the bathroom.

323
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:22,985
Well, you were gone a long time, friend.

324
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:25,187
- You feeling okay, friend?
- No, it was number two,

325
00:12:25,188 --> 00:12:28,023
and it was very intense, friend.

326
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:29,958
Bless you.

327
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,127
She sneezed. Dog allergies.

328
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:34,330
Which means that Amy took...

329
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,032
Cheddar!

330
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:38,835
Where is my dog?

331
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,693
Aren't you standing right next to him?

332
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,038
This bitch? Please. Watch.

333
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,007
Shake. Shake.

334
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:46,975
Idiot.

335
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:49,011
I know one of you took Cheddar,

336
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:50,813
and you did it for the
sake of the heist,

337
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:53,816
but if anything happens
to him, I will end you.

338
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:55,918
I couldn't bring myself
to neuter Cheddar,

339
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,653
but I will neuter you all.

340
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:00,964
Uh, bing-pot.

341
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,516
Cheddar? Cheddar?

342
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:10,835
Shake.

343
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,955
Ah, good grip, pristine coat.

344
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:14,345
That's my doggie!

345
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:16,588
You betrayed me.
You'll explain yourself later.

346
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,439
Return to my office.

347
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:22,097
Guys, why is there smoke
coming from the break room?

348
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:23,999
What's going on?
Is someone doing something?

349
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,468
Who's doing something?

350
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:27,875
"Handmaid's Tale." This is Amy.

351
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:30,049
She won't shut up about
how relevant that show is

352
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:32,541
- in today's political landscape.
- It's relevant as hell,

353
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:34,677
but I'm not doing anything.

354
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:36,612
Terry also loved the show. This is him.

355
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:38,792
No, no, I love Elisabeth Moss.

356
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,324
Terry thought the show was too bleak.

357
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:41,850
Oh, they're coming from everywhere.

358
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:44,488
Hello. Blessed be the fruit, baby.

359
00:13:44,494 --> 00:13:46,340
- Hitchcock, you watch that show?
- Watch what?

360
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:48,228
- That's my pickup line.
- What are they doing?

361
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:50,617
We haven't heard from Charles.
We need to check to make sure

362
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:52,492
- everything's fine.
- Check what? The server?

363
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,827
I stole the cummerbund from
under there an hour ago.

364
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,434
- You knew about...
- About you playing? The server?

365
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:00,305
I've known about your plans for weeks.

366
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:02,633
Uh-oh, they're circling. Stop!

367
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,174
Hello, Ofamy.

368
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:07,910
Hello.

369
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:10,405
- I don't know what's going on.
- I do.

370
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:11,914
Handmaids, out!

371
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,713
They really listen to you.

372
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,574
You figured out I had
the belt in my safe,

373
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:18,781
and you thought you could
distract me and steal the key.

374
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:20,322
I did think those things, yes,

375
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:22,992
and then... I did it.

376
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:24,860
Please. Impossible.

377
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:28,124
The key has been in my
shoe the entire time.

378
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:29,871
Okay, well, it's almost midnight.

379
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:32,114
Why don't you try and use your key?

380
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:36,362
It fits.

381
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:38,371
I knew you were lying.
You are so predictable.

382
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,610
Uh-oh, it's not turning.

383
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,882
I guess I'm not quite as
predictable as you thought.

384
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:44,013
And I also bet none of you can predict

385
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:45,090
what I'm gonna do next.

386
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:47,425
Use your key to open the safe
and act like a dick about it?

387
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:49,285
Yes, obviously that's
what I'm gonna do, Rosa.

388
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:51,420
You just have to be so
spot-on all the time.

389
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:52,821
If I may... mm...

390
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:55,345
just get my skirt up, thanks.

391
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,989
Oh, look at that, the key fits.

392
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:01,845
And the lock is turning,
and the safe is... empty?

393
00:15:01,852 --> 00:15:03,113
- What?
- There's no cummerbund?

394
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,521
- Never was. It was always a belt.
- I don't understand. Who took it?

395
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:07,827
We haven't heard from Charles in an
hour. Maybe he betrayed The Tramps.

396
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,852
Oh, God, I just called us The
Tramps. What have I become?

397
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:11,293
It's not Charles. I locked him up.

398
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,202
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, I put a
GPS tracker on the belt.

399
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:16,244
It's on the move, and it's going fast!

400
00:15:16,258 --> 00:15:17,959
Let's take my bike.
They'll never catch us.

401
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:19,882
- Later, dorks.
- Should we follow them? I...

402
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:23,585
Captain, why are you giggling?

403
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:27,623
I put a GPS tracker inside of Terry.

404
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:31,293
Sarge, Kevin purchased one too
many full-fat French yogurts.

405
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:35,998
- You want it?
- Absolutely.

406
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,434
Enjoy, Jeffords. Enjoy.

407
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:39,861
Devious, I know, but...

408
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:41,503
I also put a tracker in Terry's yogurt.

409
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:43,272
Same here. No reason.

410
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:44,740
Just 'cause you're a great sergeant.

411
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:46,775
Now suck it down.

412
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,802
Eh, no problem, take it.

413
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,312
Swallow the 'gurt.

414
00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:51,880
Do you guys think all that radiation

415
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:53,782
- is bad for him?
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

416
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:56,092
- He's lived a long life already.
- Yeah.

417
00:16:00,123 --> 00:16:01,457
Good luck keeping up with me.

418
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,092
I've done my morning calisthenics.

419
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:04,693
Oh, I'll keep up with you...

420
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:06,328
Rah!

421
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:09,932
In hell. Mua-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

422
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,607
- Hello, Jacob.
- Dah!

423
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:19,641
What... Ames...

424
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:22,223
What are you doing here? Why aren't
you out looking for the belt?

425
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,228
You and I both know the belt
never left the precinct.

426
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:25,814
I don't know that. Nobody knows that.

427
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:28,050
I kept thinking,
"How did anyone swap my key?"

428
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:31,487
And then it hit me... they didn't.
They swapped the safe.

429
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:33,722
<i>One of the handmaids,
I'm assuming fake Charles,</i>

430
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:38,219
<i>took my safe, and then Ofamy
deposited a lookalike.</i>

431
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:40,322
What did you give fake
Charles so he'd help you?

432
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,083
Nothing. In fact, he gave me something,

433
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,899
the power of financial freedom.

434
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,434
I invested in a pyramid scheme.

435
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:47,102
It's no time to go into it right now.

436
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,971
Okay... so, while we
all tried to figure out

437
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:50,484
who had the real key,

438
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:52,775
<i>fake Charles broke into the safe,
removed the tracke,</i>

439
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:55,644
<i>and led Terry and the whole
squad on a wild goose chase.</i>

440
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:58,247
My only question is,
which box is the belt in?

441
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:00,182
Well, good luck figuring it out,

442
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:02,718
because the clock is tick-tick-tocking.

443
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,290
- It's that one.
- No!

444
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:06,588
The dust pattern on top
doesn't match its neighbors.

445
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,291
You see, Jake, I'm always gonna
be one step ahead of you.

446
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,260
You've lost the ability to surprise me.

447
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:13,095
Ya just plain boring.

448
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:15,431
Again, weird take on a
very loving relationship.

449
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:16,932
And it's midnight,

450
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:20,636
so I guess I'm an amazing human/genius.

451
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:23,305
Yeah. Although...

452
00:17:23,306 --> 00:17:25,607
you might wanna read the
inscription on that there belt.

453
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:29,344
Why? Oh, no, what does it say?

454
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:31,481
"Amy Santiago, will you marry me?"

455
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,384
Surprise.

456
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,017
I'm so confused... I don't know
what's happening right now.

457
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:42,978
"I'm so confused... I don't know
what's happening right now,"

458
00:17:42,985 --> 00:17:45,789
- title of your sex tape.
- "Oh, my God, I'm shaking."

459
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:48,437
I'm definitely gonna cry,"
Title of your sex tape.

460
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:51,418
Wait, is this really happening?
Is this part of the heist?

461
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:54,029
If this is part of the heist,
I will dump you so hard.

462
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:56,471
No, please, Ames, look,
it's really happening, okay?

463
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:59,107
It's not part of the heist.
I promise, this is real.

464
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:01,809
- It is?
- Yeah.

465
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,212
Okay, here it goes.

466
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:07,148
Ames, I love you.

467
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:10,351
I love how smart you are.
I love how beautiful you are.

468
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:12,687
I love your face, and I love your butt.

469
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:14,188
I should've written this down first.

470
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:15,857
No, no, it's okay. Go on.

471
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:18,302
I love how much you pretend
to like "Die Hard."

472
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,176
- I like the second one.
- You don't have to.

473
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,718
- Okay.
- Yeah.

474
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:23,798
You're kind, and you're funny,

475
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,500
and you're the best person I know,

476
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:28,436
and the best detective.

477
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:32,607
Also, for reals, I love your butt.

478
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,609
- I love yours too.
- Gross.

479
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:38,246
Amy Santiago...

480
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:40,214
will you marry me?

481
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:42,717
Jake Peralta, I will marry you.

482
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:53,327
I love you so much.

483
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:55,296
Hey, jerkos, this little Tramp escaped,

484
00:18:55,297 --> 00:18:57,017
so that ought to teach...

485
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,767
- D-did you just...
- Mm-hmm.

486
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:01,903
- And did you say...
- Mm-hmm.

487
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,384
- To Jake and Amy.
- To Jake and Amy!

488
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:10,060
Great stuff, great stuff.

489
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,813
So, since Peralta
altered the cummerbund,

490
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:13,414
no one really won the heist this year.

491
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:14,790
Is that what everyone's thinking?

492
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:16,357
- Captain...
- Right, right, sorry.

493
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,304
Not the time. I'm so happy for you both.

494
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:20,018
Technically, there was
no winner. Continue.

495
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,181
Hey, Gina just texted me.

496
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:23,791
She said, "Weird, I didn't even
realize they were dating."

497
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:25,993
JK, so happy for you bitches."

498
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:28,296
- Oh.
- So, Jake, tell us everything.

499
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:30,865
- Did you call Amy's dad first?
- I actually did.

500
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:32,967
Mr. Santiago, I'm calling to inform you

501
00:19:32,968 --> 00:19:34,836
that I plan to ask your
daughter to marry me,

502
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:37,939
but since it's 2017, I am not
asking you for your permission,

503
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,396
as she is not your property,

504
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:41,448
nor would she be mine,
if she chooses to say yes.

505
00:19:41,455 --> 00:19:43,944
She's a strong independent woman,
and she don't need no man.

506
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,880
That being said,
I truly hope she says yes.

507
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:47,648
But it's her decision, so just back off!

508
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:50,051
Aww, that was perfect. What did he say?

509
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:52,687
I have no idea, I left a voicemail.
I'm terrified of him.

510
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:54,052
Not to talk out of turn,

511
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,492
but I think I get credit for
giving Jake the idea to propose.

512
00:19:57,493 --> 00:19:58,893
- How's that?
- Remember?

513
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:00,027
That day in the kitchen.

514
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:01,395
So, what I'm saying is,

515
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:02,797
vanilla yogurt is good,

516
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,500
but pair it with a blueberry yogurt,

517
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:07,468
and both of them taste even better.

518
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:09,696
- Get it?
- Yes?

519
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:10,758
I did not get it,

520
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:13,835
but speaking of yogurt, you've
eaten six GPS devices this week.

521
00:20:13,842 --> 00:20:15,042
You should see a doctor.

522
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:16,081
- What?
- Hm?

523
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:18,212
Look, Sarge, I think everyone knows that

524
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:20,014
I planted the idea in Jake's head

525
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:22,016
eight years ago.

526
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:25,019
Oh, hi, I'm starting today.
Detective Santiago.

527
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,722
Oh, Detective Peralta. Welcome aboard.

528
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:30,691
I'm hearing wedding bells.

529
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:32,097
Hi, Detective Boyle.

530
00:20:32,104 --> 00:20:33,906
That actually really slowed things down.

531
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:36,075
It took, like, four years for
me to forget that memory.

532
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:38,745
- Yeah, I'm my own worst enemy.
- Look, no one gave me the idea.

533
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:42,503
I decided to ask Amy to marry
me all on my own on April 28th.

534
00:20:42,504 --> 00:20:46,082
There's a typo in
this crossword puzzle.

535
00:20:47,174 --> 00:20:49,246
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.c

536
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:50,855
I don't get it. Seems pretty normal.

537
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:53,026
I don't know what to tell you.
That's just when I knew.

538
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:54,482
Romantic epiphanies are dope.

539
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:56,050
Thank you, Rosa. They are dope.

540
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:58,085
Yes, dope. Congratulations.

541
00:20:58,086 --> 00:20:59,698
I'm so happy you two
are getting married.

542
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:02,223
- We're getting married.
- We're getting married!

543
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:04,959
- And no one won the heist.
- Captain!

544
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,527
Get over it, ya jag!

545
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:07,963
Yeah, ya jag!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

1
00:00:01,187 --> 00:00:03,612
Hey, Charles, can we talk in
the briefing room for a sec?

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:05,412
- There's a question I gotta ask you.
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:10,219
It's happening.

4
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:11,750
Jake is gonna pop the question.

5
00:00:11,786 --> 00:00:13,885
- He's gonna ask me to be his BM.
- No.

6
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:15,816
BM, best man, is a common abbreviation.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,785
No one but you has ever used it.

8
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,322
I am so relieved.

9
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:21,394
I thought maybe he was gonna
ask one of Amy's brothers

10
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,698
or, ugh, Sarge.

11
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:24,525
- Hey, man, come on.
- Charles!

12
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:31,199
Okay, so I know this is a lot to ask...

13
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,500
No, it's not. I want to do it.

14
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,086
You want to cover my shift this weekend

15
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:35,472
so I can go to the White Plains Mall

16
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,550
and meet Darryl Strawberry at the
opening of a cellphone store?

17
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,407
Yes.

18
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:41,474
It's exactly what I was hoping
you'd ask.

19
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,644
Great. Thanks. You sure it's okay?

20
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,446
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,776
I'm very happy about it.
It'll be fun. It'll be fun.

22
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:50,165
Uh, look at my smile. Have to go now.

23
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,321
Surprise!

24
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,289
Oh, my God!

25
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:57,137
- Jake!
- What do you say, bud?

26
00:00:57,173 --> 00:01:00,738
- Will you be my BM?
- Yes! Yes, a million times, yes!

27
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:02,569
In your face, Terry!

28
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,119
What? I'm holding a sparkler for you.

29
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:05,633
I helped organize a lot of this.

30
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,413
Well, you can stick that
sparkler up your butt.

31
00:01:07,449 --> 00:01:08,950
I'm the best man!

32
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:28,349

33
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,159
Captain, allow me to introduce you

34
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:34,462
to major East Coast arms dealer
Dan "Daniel" Valdano.

35
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,702
That's right, his nickname is
longer than his actual name.

36
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:38,773
- Why's that, Terry?
- 'Cause he's a dick.

37
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:41,700
We got a warrant to bug him,
but his house is a fortress

38
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:43,270
and he never goes anywhere in public.

39
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:45,259
Luckily, CI just gave us a break.

40
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:47,524
Valdano's gonna actually leave his house

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,810
to go to a high stakes
poker game this Friday.

42
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:53,191
If we can get a seat at that table,
we can lose this watch to him.

43
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:54,542
And guess what. It's...

44
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:56,502
- Bugged!
- Yes, it's bugged.

45
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:57,654
Good guess, Captain.

46
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,734
The plan is, we go to the club tonight,

47
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,037
show off our poker skills, and get
an invite to the high stakes game.

48
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:05,342
All we need is $15,000
to get in the door.

49
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:06,872
That's a lot of money.
How are your poker skills?

50
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:08,435
A'ight.

51
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:09,490
- Good.
- A'ight.

52
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:10,531
- Hecka good.
- A'ight.

53
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,342
- So good.
- Perhaps I should see for myself.

54
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:14,566
- Oh. Do you play?
- I am...

55
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:17,119
- A'ight.
- Damn, Cap.

56
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:19,624
- Are you secretly cool?
- Well, poker is just math,

57
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,175
so I guess it depends on if you consider

58
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:24,657
the mathematician
Carl Friedrich Gauss cool.

59
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,380
I do not.

60
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:28,148
All right, let's play some cards.

61
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:30,065
Sarge asked me to help you
guys with some filing.

62
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:31,966
Holy crap, this is gonna take all day.

63
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,105
Yup, it's what we call an all-dayer.

64
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:35,599
How long did it take you two
to come up with that?

65
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:38,192
- That was a two-dayer.
- Okay, well, hand me some files.

66
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,431
You're not gonna bother
actually walking?

67
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,426
Why should we?
We can work from down here.

68
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:47,257
I'm sitting down as long as I can.

69
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,537
I'm not getting out of the chair
till it's time to go home.

70
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,273
- Ugh.
- Oh, typical standing elite.

71
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,533
You couldn't sit all day if you tried.

72
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,005
What? You don't think I could
outlast you turds in a chair?

73
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,298
Honey, you don't have the ass for it.

74
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:02,876
Let's talk terms.

75
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:05,253
Both cheeks on the cushion at all times.

76
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,692
Obviously. Bathroom breaks?

77
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,136
Two and a half minutes
every three hours.

78
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:10,054
But you gotta roll the chair
fully into the stall.

79
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,760
- Obviously.
- Okay.

80
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,779
- Let's do this.
- Welcome to the Buttlympics.

81
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:21,313
I call to order the meeting of investors

82
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:24,308
in the forthcoming Charles
Boyle owned-and-operated

83
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:25,967
food truck venture.

84
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,976
I know I'm the only investor,
but is it cool if I take minutes?

85
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,438
Yes. Put this down: we got a truck.

86
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:33,447
What? Really? That's huge.

87
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:34,482
Take a look.

88
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,984
Is that the NYPD police auction site?

89
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,452
Yeah, that's how I found out about it.

90
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:40,721
And there's our baby. Isn't she a...

91
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,142
Murder truck?

92
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:44,325
That's the truck from the
Tinga Time Taco murders!

93
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:46,204
Yes, two brothers were
using a taco truck

94
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,148
to move heroin and then were
killed by the cartel

95
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:50,062
- that supplied them.
- Not just killed, Boyle.

96
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:51,933
Dismembered. Right in the truck.

97
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:54,848
Right in our truck. That's
why it was such bargain.

98
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:58,000
Everyone else was like, "Ooh,
there's a knee in the fryer.

99
00:03:58,036 --> 00:04:00,126
I don't want to sell food out of this."

100
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:02,730
- They found a knee in the fryer?
- Exactly. You get it.

101
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:04,661
Well, now I get to go pick it up.

102
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,515
Oh, almost forgot my hazmat suit.

103
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,805
And... I win again.

104
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:15,084
Which is not surprising, given
how you are both terrible.

105
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,650
You don't even know the terminology.

106
00:04:16,686 --> 00:04:19,140
- What are you talking about? "Hit me."
- That is blackjack.

107
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,264
- Snake-eyes.
- Craps.

108
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:21,726
- Go Fish.
- And I believe that is

109
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,902
- Go Fish.
- Fine.

110
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:24,368
Jake stinks, but I can play.

111
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:26,944
Yes, but you have a rather
unfortunate tell:

112
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,120
your right breast.

113
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:31,027
Oh, no. My cards are terrible.

114
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:32,540
Sure they are.

115
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,131
Dammit, Eugene, you sold me out!

116
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,377
Captain, do I have a tell?

117
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:36,866
No, you don't understand
the game well enough

118
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,316
- to have a tell.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

119
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:39,734
What about you? What's your tell?

120
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,917
It is subtle. You will never discern it.

121
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:44,518
Oh, really? Well, challenge accepted.

122
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:46,090
Tell me a lie.

123
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:47,455
You're both great at poker

124
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:48,693
and I'm not gonna cancel the mission.

125
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,464
Nope, I couldn't see it. Wait, what?

126
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,934
You're cancelling the mission?
You can't do that.

127
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,706
This is our only shot
at catching Valdano.

128
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,244
It's a foolish plan.
Neither of you have any chance

129
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,873
of making it to the VIP table.

130
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,544
But maybe you could. What if you played?

131
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,947
No, I don't gamble anymore.

132
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:01,802
A few years back I had
a minor addiction,

133
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,688
specifically involving...

134
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:05,409
the ponies.

135
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,808
I'd like to bet $20,000 on...

136
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:11,679
Yabba Dabba Doo.

137
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:13,767
Sadly, Yabba Dabba Doo stumbled

138
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:15,616
and had to be put down
in front all of us.

139
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,385
- Oh. That's fun.
- Wait.

140
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:19,806
What if I never went inside the casino?

141
00:05:19,842 --> 00:05:21,355
I could be outside
in a surveillance van,

142
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,457
telling Peralta what to do.

143
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:25,288
Smart. That way you never
technically gamble.

144
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,727
- Right.
- I don't know.

145
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,762
Addiction is nothing to
fool around with.

146
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:31,404
I had food issues.
I ate a crate of hams once.

147
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,700
Yeah, and look at you now.

148
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,104
You're like a super-jacked
He-man guy, right?

149
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,221
It's settled; we'll go with
the captain's plan.

150
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:41,281
Here's your persona: you're
Billy "Big Time" Jankowski.

151
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:44,229
You wear sunglasses, headphones,
and an unwashed hoodie.

152
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:46,072
You normally gamble online,

153
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:47,870
from your mother's basement,
where you live.

154
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:49,417
Seems unnecessary.

155
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,419
The hoodie hides your
sunglass-camera's electronics.

156
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:54,040
I more meant the living in
my mom's basement virgin vibe.

157
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:57,509
You added the virgin, but I like it.
It's part of your backstory now.

158
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:59,322
- But...
- You're a virgin. That's an order.

159
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,093
But I don't want to be a virgin again.

160
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,553
Okay, I'm approaching the table.

161
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:06,178
Evening, gentlemen.
Let's play some cards.

162
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:07,782
And now, Peralta, say the following...

163
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:10,738
I'm coming in under the gun,
and I've 15k behind.

164
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,522
Okay.

165
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:14,282
Action's on you.

166
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:17,896
Mmm, tasty. Raise it 500.

167
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:19,447
Raise it 5-hundo.

168
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,614
- Made up my own.
- What?

169
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,889
I'm just talking to myself.

170
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:23,653
I'm used to playing online,
so it's not weird.

171
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,889
Well, well, well.

172
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,892
You flopped the absolute nuts,
Peralta. Go all in.

173
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,935
Are you sure?
On the first hand, Captain?

174
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:35,696
It's what the math dictates.

175
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,699
At this moment there are no two
cards that can beat Peralta.

176
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:40,501
- I'm all in.
- And now they all fold

177
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,887
like so much recently dried linen.

178
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:44,291
- I'll call.
- What an idiot.

179
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:45,362
Two players.

180
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,724
- What?
- Full house wins.

181
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,757
- Yes!
- No, he won; not you.

182
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:54,150
You're out of chips.

183
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:55,483
Oh, well, that sucks.

184
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,451
Guess I'll just head back
to my mom's basement.

185
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:58,519
I'm a virgin.

186
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:04,558
All clear. No poopers.
Repeat: No poopers.

187
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:05,959
That was a disaster.

188
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,844
I thought Holt was supposed
to be great at this.

189
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:10,850
- Any poopers?
- All clear.

190
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:12,098
What happened, Captain?

191
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:13,667
That imbecile in the trucker hat

192
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:16,167
hit both his runners and
sucked out on the river.

193
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,571
Yeah, he did. What does that mean?

194
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:20,774
Not to worry. The odds of that
happening again are infinitesimal.

195
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,810
Not that it matters.
Since we're out of money.

196
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:24,828
Oh, but we're not.

197
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,987
- Where'd this come from?
- It's my money.

198
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:29,657
There are 25 ATMs in this place.

199
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:31,018
Even the fire exit has one.

200
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,887
You want us to use your own money?
You sure that's a good idea?

201
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,564
I haven't placed a bet
or touched a card.

202
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,734
I'm fine.

203
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:39,212
Technically that is true.

204
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:41,248
Trust me; the math is in our favor.

205
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:44,632
All right, let's get back in
there and suck out two runners

206
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:45,999
down by the river.

207
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:48,082
- Did I say that right?
- Not even close.

208
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:49,169
Yeah, I didn't think so.

209
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,704
Still, let's get in there
and suck 'em out.

210
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:51,924
No time like the present.

211
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,538
And no place to do it like
the men's bathroom,

212
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,176
to leave from here to go do
what we're talking about.

213
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:59,661
Ugh. Nine hours and 55 minutes.

214
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:01,449
Is it? I feel like I just sat down.

215
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:04,079
I have no feeling down there whatsoever.

216
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:07,467
I haven't in years.

217
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:09,344
I'm doing great too.
This has been a piece of ca...

218
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,512
Oh, butt cramp. Butt cramp!

219
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:12,726
That sounds painful.

220
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,501
I bet you could use some electrolytes.

221
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,466
- Give me that! That's mine.
- Come get it.

222
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,866
You'll never catch me!

223
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,124
Oh, won't I?

224
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:21,479
Oh!

225
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:28,175
Cramp over.

226
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:30,007
And so is our shift.

227
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,579
Ha. And you thought I couldn't...
Wait, what are you doing?

228
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:34,662
You thought we were done just
because our shift was over?

229
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,049
- Amateur.
- Oh.

230
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,651
So you wanna take this thing
into overtime?

231
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,693
Fine. I got no place to be.

232
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,297
Neither do I. I never do.

233
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,724
Then it's agreed. The games continue.

234
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:46,049
And now you're going to...

235
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:48,118
- Fold.
- Fold.

236
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,534
- Fold.
- Fold.

237
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,899
- Fold.
- Fold.

238
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,834
Should we consider cutting our losses?

239
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,066
Hush, Sergeant. Our cards are coming.

240
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:59,671
And there she is.

241
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:00,789
- You won.
- I won.

242
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:02,033
- You won!
- Won again.

243
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:03,435
- That's our straight.
- And again, again.

244
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:04,800
Hot damn!

245
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,219
Peralta, say "hot damn."

246
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,017
- Hot damn!
- Now you say it.

247
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:10,005
- Hot damn!
- Full house.

248
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,051
Eights over threes.

249
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,248
Good. Now say to the dealer...

250
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,220
Well, this has been fun.

251
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:17,057
But I'm sick of playing with...

252
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,026
wittle wittle babies.

253
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,236
Is there a table for people
who wear big boy pants?

254
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:25,766
Actually, there's
a private game on Friday

255
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,041
I think you might like.

256
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:30,830
Much obliged.

257
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,941
- Hey, there, bud.
- Hey.

258
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,076
Can we talk about the murder
truck we just purchased

259
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,881
with our very hard-earned money?

260
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:40,016
Oh, Amy, wait till you see her.

261
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,378
I spent all night pressure-washing her,

262
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,007
and she is spotless.

263
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:46,165
Yeah, it's just, what if word gets out

264
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,303
that our food truck was
the site of a double homicide?

265
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:49,640
What if word gets out?

266
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:52,047
It's in the "Our Story"
section of the menu.

267
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,545
We're calling it Murder Truck!

268
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:54,803
- We are?
- Yeah!

269
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,748
- It was your idea.
- No, it was my greatest fear.

270
00:09:57,784 --> 00:10:00,250
I can't believe you're leaning
into the murder thing.

271
00:10:00,286 --> 00:10:02,805
Well, it'll get people talking.
Check out the menu.

272
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,851
It's printed on a crime scene photo.

273
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:06,315
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

274
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:08,225
Charles, we're gonna
lose all of our money.

275
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:09,810
Are you worried?

276
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,433
Oh, okay, I see what's happening.

277
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:14,748
Starting a business is very scary.

278
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,963
But I promise you,
once you see our truck,

279
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,144
you'll feel a lot better. Come on.

280
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:24,689
No, no, no, no, no! My truck!
My beautiful truck!

281
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:25,993
Someone killed ripped her apart!

282
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,483
Charles, please tell me you
got insurance.

283
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,996
- I did.
- Okay, thank God.

284
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,922
Coverage starts tomorrow.

285
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:34,494
Well, Valdano's gonna be there tonight,

286
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,098
and the recording device in
the watch is transmitting.

287
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:39,168
I feel like Bond. Terry Bond.

288
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:41,174
Well, technically I'm the
one wearing the watch,

289
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,843
so that would make you Q at best.

290
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,891
- Terry Q.
- Yeah. Way to roll with it.

291
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,983
Come on, let's tell Holt
we're prepped for tonight.

292
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,818
I gotta say, I was wrong about him.

293
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:51,118
He had no problem
walking away last night.

294
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:53,236
He left a lot of hams in that crate.

295
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:54,354
Juicy.

296
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,168
Spiral-cut, honey-sweet but salty...

297
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:58,910
- Sarge, come back to me.
- What?

298
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:00,429
You're the one that brought up ham.

299
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:03,314
- That was you.
- Yes, yes, come to papa.

300
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,166
Raise it a grand! Call. Raise.

301
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,502
A pair of candy canes. I'm all in, baby.

302
00:11:08,538 --> 00:11:10,137
- What are you doing, sir?
- Working the case.

303
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:11,803
Sharpening my poker skills for Valdano.

304
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,875
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, and why are you watching
this children's beauty pageant?

305
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,844
For fun, obviously.

306
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,312
No, Jayla, don't drop the baton.

307
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:22,068
No, I had so much riding on you!

308
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:24,640
Oh no. He is deep in the ham crate.

309
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,189
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

310
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,163
Captain Holt's been in his
office gambling for hours.

311
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,879
Our only choice is to
cut off his internet.

312
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:34,925
No, I mean, are you sure
you know how to do that?

313
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,549
Of course. I just have to pull this...

314
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:37,603
Oh!

315
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:40,611
- Gah.
- Wrong wire.

316
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:42,735
Yep, we'll... we'll fix that later.

317
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:44,171
And...

318
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,555
- What the hell?
- Got it.

319
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,518
Having trouble with your internet, sir?

320
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,749
He's not here. Where'd he go?

321
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:51,920
Roof.

322
00:11:51,956 --> 00:11:53,413
What are you doing?

323
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,529
Trying to pick up a Wi-Fi
signal from across the street.

324
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:58,351
I've got $8,000 riding on little Jayla.

325
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:00,447
Don't you think you have
a bit of a problem here, sir?

326
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:02,023
I'm in complete control.

327
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:04,487
Now, Terry, come over here and dangle me
off the edge of this building.

328
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:07,394
Sir, I am not going to dangle you
off the side of this building.

329
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,829
You're fired. Peralta, let
me climb onto your shoulders.

330
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,063
- I can't...
- You're fired.

331
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,462
No one works here anymore.

332
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,753
Look, we need to have a real
talk about your gambling.

333
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:16,011
Relapsing is nothing to be ashamed of.

334
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:18,514
A couple years ago on my
birthday I treated myself

335
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,073
to one piece of pizza.

336
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:23,718
I woke up the next morning in a
Sbarro on the Jersey Turnpike.

337
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:24,937
It wasn't even open!

338
00:12:24,973 --> 00:12:26,346
That's not what's happening here.

339
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,815
I'm not weak like you.
I can stop whenever I want.

340
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,404
- Then stop.
- I don't want.

341
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,678
Now if you'll excuse me,

342
00:12:32,714 --> 00:12:34,837
I'm heading to the acai
bowl internet café.

343
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:38,027
Got a lot of money riding on the NLCS,
whatever the hell that is.

344
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:39,705
We can't let you do that.

345
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:42,795
And how exactly will you stop me?

346
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:45,517
We'll call your husband.

347
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:47,945
No.

348
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:51,240
No, I can't put Kevin
through this, not again.

349
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:53,534
You're right. I've lost control,

350
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,678
and I'm taking myself off this case.

351
00:12:55,912 --> 00:13:00,072
And I'm not going anywhere
near gambling again.

352
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,596
- You promise?
- From the bottom of my heart.

353
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:05,972
It's a dead issue.

354
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:07,729
I'm proud of you, sir.

355
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:09,256
So am I, Captain.

356
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:12,682
So I'm sorry. Terry,
you went to Jersey for pizza?

357
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:15,128
- I had a problem, man!
- Right, sorry.

358
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:18,716
Ugh, how long have we been sitting?
My butt's lost track of time.

359
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:21,693
- Coming up on 32 hours.
- I miss the little things.

360
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:24,371
Showers. Feeling my feet.

361
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,893
- Standing.
- I miss my home chair.

362
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:28,013
You miss a chair?

363
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:30,164
I just want walk up to the
hot dog stand out front

364
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,488
and get a fresh wiener.

365
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,643
Oh, man. Why did you say
that? Now I want one.

366
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,329
- So you should go get one.
- Oh, and let you win?

367
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:37,003
You're just trying to get us
to stand up.

368
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,501
No. We should all go get one...

369
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,690
- in our chairs.
- She's right.

370
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:43,961
The only thing holding us
back is society.

371
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:55,784
Mmm. So good.

372
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:58,664
I got it. No.

373
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,033
- My ass.
- It left the chair.

374
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:02,667
I'm sorry, man.

375
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:06,079
No. It was my time.

376
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,331
It's our time too.

377
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,941
We've been through hell together.
Now we stand together.

378
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:14,268
Nope. Legs are dead.

379
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:15,483
Going down.

380
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:18,642
Charles, what are you doing?

381
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:20,193
I know having our truck smashed to bits

382
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:23,123
was a bit of a setback, but
don't worry; I have an idea.

383
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,999
The truck was deconstructed so we do...

384
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:28,256
Not have a business anymore?

385
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:30,848
No. We do deconstructed food.

386
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:33,296
For instance, a deconstructed
meatball sub:

387
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,745
a meatball, rolled in breadcrumbs

388
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:38,278
with a caramelized tomato sauce drizzle.

389
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:40,309
- Taste it.
- Charles,

390
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:42,532
I appreciate that you're trying
to fix this situation,

391
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:43,747
but you don't have to.

392
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,084
I have great news.

393
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,201
I know who robbed us.

394
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:48,251
The cartel who did
the taco truck murders

395
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,991
ripped apart the truck, because
there was heroin still inside it.

396
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,213
We found opioid traces
behind the fridge.

397
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:55,397
I had forensics scour the truck for DNA

398
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:58,296
and we got a match: a cartel enforcer.

399
00:14:58,453 --> 00:14:59,653
Do you know what this means?

400
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:01,268
The truck becomes a crime scene again.

401
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,744
Yes! It's been impounded.
We get our money back!

402
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:05,847
Great.

403
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,819
I'm glad you get your money back.

404
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:11,241
You can invest it in something
you actually believe in instead of...

405
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,747
My balls.

406
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:15,353
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have 50 pounds of meat

407
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,819
I have to return before it goes rotten.

408
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:20,289
Like my dreams.

409
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:25,733
There's Valdano.
The watch is transmitting.

410
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,670
All you have to do is lose it to him.

411
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:29,774
- Worst of luck to you.
- Don't worry, Terry.

412
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,032
I'm about to crap the bed.

413
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:34,738
Evening, gentlemen.
Ready for some poker?

414
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:37,406
- That's why we're here.
- Good one, stranger.

415
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,929
I'll take 150.

416
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:40,779
Hot damn!

417
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:42,091
Four queens.

418
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:44,921
I call this hand the Golden Girls.

419
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:47,666
Damn it. Oh, you would look at that.

420
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:50,562
My mom's calling me.
She's flipping her lid

421
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,339
because she found all my
nudie mags in the basement.

422
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,709
Anyways, BRB.

423
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:58,386
What happened to not wanting
to gamble anymore for Kevin?

424
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:01,144
Sir, you are spiraling. You
lied straight to our faces.

425
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,295
Well, that's on you.

426
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,618
If you could spot my tell,
you would've known.

427
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:05,859
Fine. What's your tell?

428
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:07,525
Let's just say, I'm doing it right now.

429
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:09,225
I'm doing it at this very moment.

430
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,375
- Is it standing up?
- I've just done it again.

431
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:13,144
Whoops, there's another time.

432
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,269
I don't understand.
Even if you wanted to gamble,

433
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:17,032
why come here, where we'd be?

434
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:19,899
I lost some money on lame little Jayla,

435
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,998
and I realized that's because
I've been gambling

436
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:25,440
instead of being down here
doing what I'm good at... math.

437
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:27,911
Now go get Valdano before
you blow your covers.

438
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:31,352
I'm off duty; what I do on my
own time is my own business.

439
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:33,710
Unlike you two who are
still on the clock

440
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:35,331
and are now being bad cops.

441
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,989
Wow, listen to you talking all smooth.

442
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:39,785
But you can't fool us, sir.

443
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:41,427
You might as well face it.

444
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:43,869
You're addicted to math. Robert Palmer.

445
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:45,391
Come on, Sarge. Let's go.

446
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:52,055
So you're a cop.

447
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,045
There was a pooper.

448
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,776
Sorry about that.

449
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:01,054
Crisis averted: I told her
I read the magazines

450
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,926
for the articles. She totally bought it.

451
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:05,525
- Wait a sec, where are you going?
- Got called away on business.

452
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,966
Come back next Friday; I'll
take your money from you then.

453
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,565
Well, we'll just see about
that, Mr. Cool Voice.

454
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:15,034
His voice is really cool.

455
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:23,869
So I understand you're a cop

456
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:25,714
who's trying to bring me down.

457
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,547
Why don't we take a little drive?

458
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,418
Why did you stay at the table so long
after Valdano was already gone?

459
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,534
It would've been suspicious
if I left right after he did,

460
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,913
so I played a couple hands.

461
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:36,507
Come on, let's grab Holt
and get out of here.

462
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:38,220
Wait. Where's Holt?

463
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:41,635
So what was your plan, cop?

464
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:44,836
Does it matter? We failed and
now you know we're onto you.

465
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:46,627
You get to come out ahead tonight,

466
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:48,790
provided you don't do
anything dumb right now.

467
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,526
My colleagues are calling,
probably wondering where I am.

468
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:55,295
Then put their minds at ease.

469
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,388
- Yes?
- Captain.

470
00:17:58,424 --> 00:17:59,479
We're leaving. Where are you?

471
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,798
I've already left.
I don't enjoy being judged,

472
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:04,032
so I'm on my way to Atlantic
City for the weekend.

473
00:18:04,068 --> 00:18:05,104
I'll be gambling.

474
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,642
No, sir, please just come back, okay?

475
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:09,218
Terry and I will keep you company.

476
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,434
We'll go to a museum.

477
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,336
One of the boring ones
with no dinosaurs.

478
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:14,207
Forget it. I shouldn't've answered.

479
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:21,671
Bye-bye "Toxic."

480
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:23,578
Bye-bye "Party in the USA."

481
00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:25,016
Hey, Charles. What are you doing?

482
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:27,749
I'm deleting all the upbeat
music off my computer.

483
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:28,939
I know you're down, but...

484
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,919
Bye-bye "Swish Swish Bish."

485
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:33,223
Look, I feel really bad
about the way I treated you.

486
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:34,364
Well, you shouldn't.

487
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,778
You're the only one who saw
that my dream was stupid

488
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,330
and then you got me all my money back.

489
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:41,489
Well, after you left,
I tried one of your meatballs

490
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:42,693
and then another.

491
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:44,686
And another. I couldn't stop

492
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:46,760
because they were so damn good.

493
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:48,321
Really? You liked them?

494
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:51,433
I loved them. I should have
tried them earlier.

495
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:53,439
I lost track of the fact
that this whole thing

496
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:55,803
was supposed to be about your food.

497
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,310
I think we should buy
another food truck.

498
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,647
- You do?
- Yes.

499
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:00,494
But I have some conditions:

500
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,829
1, it cannot be a crime scene;

501
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:05,724
2, you have to get insurance on day one;

502
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,869
3, you have to keep dreaming up
amazing things to cook.

503
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,991
You're so good, Boyle.

504
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:13,168
Deal! We're gonna buy a food truck!

505
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:15,086
We're gonna get a food truck! Yes!

506
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:16,613
Stop!

507
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:19,164
I ate too many meatballs.

508
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,193
Oh.

509
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:22,952
- Where we going?
- Atlantic City.

510
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:24,621
That's where you told
your friends you'd be,

511
00:19:24,657 --> 00:19:26,096
so that's where they'll find your body.

512
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,357
I'm a captain in the NYPD.

513
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:31,121
Yeah, and you're also
a known gambling addict.

514
00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:33,193
You lost all your money in A.C.

515
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,948
and then drowned yourself in the ocean.

516
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:40,889
Stay down!

517
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:42,682
NYPD! Keep your hands on the wheel.

518
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,796
Hey there, Captain Holt.

519
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:47,471
We just saved your big ol' butt.

520
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,796
Hello, Dan "Daniel" Valdano.

521
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:52,044
- Guess what.
- You're a dick!

522
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:53,618
Yeah.

523
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:54,915
How did you find me?

524
00:19:54,951 --> 00:19:56,945
We traced your phone
and tracked down the limo.

525
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:59,451
Wait. How did you even know
I was in trouble?

526
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,287
I figured out your tell.

527
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:04,200
When you're lying, you use contractions.
Lots of 'em.

528
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,242
I've lost control.
I'm taking myself off the case.

529
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:09,503
I've just done it again.
Whoops. There's another time.

530
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,542
I shouldn't've have answered.
Shouldn't've answered.

531
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:12,679
Shouldn't've...

532
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:15,648
It was the "shouldn't've"
that finally tipped me off.

533
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:18,270
I've never heard you use
a double contraction before.

534
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:20,453
And you never will again.

535
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,277
I was at rock bottom.

536
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,663
I feel so embarrassed.

537
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:28,389
I understand. I've been there.

538
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:31,035
I once ate a box of uncooked
rice in a movie theater.

539
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,317
Wow, really?

540
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:34,029
- Jake.
- I'm sorry.

541
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:37,427
I owe you two a tremendous
debt of gratitude.

542
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,541
I was overwhelmed by my addiction
and you were there for me.

543
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,211
Of course, sir.
We'd do anything for you.

544
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:48,639
Perhaps you two would take me
to a meeting of Gambler's Anonymous.

545
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:51,200
- Absolutely.
- And, Jake, before we go,

546
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:54,325
- I need to admit one more thing.
- Of course, anything.

547
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:56,123
When I made you tell that table

548
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,507
that you were living
in your mother's basement,

549
00:20:57,543 --> 00:20:58,917
it wasn't for the case.

550
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,798
I was just messing with you.

551
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:03,155
Oh, well played, sir.

552
00:21:03,191 --> 00:21:04,458
But the joke's on you.

553
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,469
My mother has a fantastic basement.

554
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:07,907
Title of your sex tape. Too soon?

555
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,001
All right, let's go.

556
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:11,972
Hey, standing desk.

557
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:13,645
Look who's taking care of herself.

558
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:16,008
- Someone's not sitting down on the job.
- Hey.

559
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,601
Sitting down on the job
is damned hard work,

560
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:20,697
and those heroes prove it every day.

561
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,154
Mad respect.

562
00:21:23,163 --> 00:21:25,585
Okay. Sorry.

563
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,229
Seriously, you guys should
stand up once in a while.

564
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:29,644
You know, for your hearts.

565
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:36,955

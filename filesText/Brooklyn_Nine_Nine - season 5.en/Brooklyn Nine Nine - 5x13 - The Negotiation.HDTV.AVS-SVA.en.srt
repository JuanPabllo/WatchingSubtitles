1
00:00:00,632 --> 00:00:02,440
Peralta, there was a botched B & E

2
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:03,742
at a jewelry store on Atlantic

3
00:00:03,777 --> 00:00:05,543
that just turned into
a hostage situation.

4
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:07,078
They want you to be the negotiator.

5
00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:09,447
Oh, my God, my prayers
have finally been answered.

6
00:00:09,482 --> 00:00:10,649
You prayed for a hostage situation?

7
00:00:10,684 --> 00:00:12,250
Yes, I did. Every single day.

8
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:13,985
I don't understand.
Why isn't ESU handling this?

9
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,588
Apparently, the hostage-taker
asked for Jake by name.

10
00:00:16,623 --> 00:00:18,356
Oh, yes, it's getting even cooler.

11
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:20,025
Oh, man, I wonder who it is. Ooh!

12
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,826
Maybe it's the brother
of someone I put away for life.

13
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:24,029
Ooh! Or the identical twin of
someone I put away for life.

14
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,797
- Ooh! Or the fraternal twin of...
- Jake!

15
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:27,098
Just get down there! Take Diaz with you.

16
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,733
Yep. Yep, yep, yep. How do I look?

17
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:30,041
It doesn't matter. Let's go negotiate!

18
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:34,873
Hey, everyone, I'm here.

19
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:37,008
I'm Jake Peralta, the negotiator.

20
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:39,511
- Oh, so you're Jake Peralta?
- The negotiator, yes.

21
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:41,713
- Who are you?
- Dennis Kole, ESU.

22
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:44,188
This was my crime scene
before you bozos got here.

23
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:45,594
Nice to meet you too, Dennis.

24
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,352
I've spent ten years as a negotiator

25
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:49,821
and you just took
my first hostage situation.

26
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:52,190
All I've done up till now is
talk jumpers off of rooftops.

27
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:54,459
But that must be satisfying
in its own way, right?

28
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:57,989
Yeah, really satisfying
saving a crazy person's life.

29
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,715
Whatever. Here's a little advice.

30
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:01,199
- I don't like you two.
- Not so much advice

31
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:03,802
as it is a hurtful statement
based on limited interaction.

32
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:05,543
He wants to talk to you.

33
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:09,458
- Get the hell in there.
- Ooh, it says "negotiator" on it.

34
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:14,015
This is Jake Peralta.

35
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:16,158
I am unarmed

36
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:18,602
and I'm approaching the building

37
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:31,262
- You wanted to talk to me?
- Keep those hands in the air.

38
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:33,365
And wave 'em like you just don't care.

39
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,632
What?

40
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,067
I'm just messing with you, Peralta.

41
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:37,893
Put your hands down,
give me a hug, baby.

42
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:38,904
Judy!

43
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:57,674

44
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:00,792
Sergeant, a member of

45
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:02,570
the Commissioner selection
committee is coming in today

46
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,280
to tour the precinct
and do some interviews.

47
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:05,551
Would you mind speaking with her?

48
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:06,931
Of course. Terry loves answering

49
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,266
the hard questions.

50
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:09,567
Oh, here she is.

51
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:11,803
I guess you don't have time to take off
those ridiculous suspenders.

52
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:13,538
- What?
- Hello, Miss Sumter.

53
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:14,873
Hello, Captain.

54
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:16,241
I'm excited to speak to you subordinates

55
00:02:16,276 --> 00:02:17,976
and learn more about
your management style.

56
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:20,044
I thought you could talk
to Sergeant Jeffords here.

57
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,880
Sergeant? Oh, um...

58
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:23,548
I'd rather not talk to a supervisor.

59
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,717
I was hoping to interview
one of your detectives.

60
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:28,324
Perhaps, um... him?

61
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,621
No!

62
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:32,857
- Excuse me?
- There was a wasp near me,

63
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:34,559
which has since disappeared.

64
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:36,628
You can interview Detective Hitchcock

65
00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:39,211
and I am completely fine with that.

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,033
I gotta admit, man.

67
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:43,902
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

68
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,603
- Why you being so weird.
- Oh, I don't know.

69
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:48,039
I didn't sleep well last night,
so I'm probably tired from that.

70
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:49,808
Oh, and also,
this is a hostage situation!

71
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:52,811
Wow! It's like that.

72
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:54,579
Yes, it's like that. What the hell?

73
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:56,047
- I thought you went straight?
- I did.

74
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:57,615
I'm a high-end car broker now.

75
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,162
I procure luxury vehicles
for the rich and famous

76
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:01,305
and I do it legally.

77
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:02,520
Last week I dropped off a Bugatti

78
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:04,022
to the kid with the lisp
from "Stranger Things."

79
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:05,890
You met Dustin? Was he cool?

80
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:07,570
Do him and the rest of the gang
hang out in real life?

81
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:08,893
You know what? No.
We are not chatting right now.

82
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,161
You have three hostages.

83
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:11,763
You mean Pam and the two Bobs?

84
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:13,498
They not hostages. I prefer to call them

85
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,033
"collateral friendships."

86
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:16,901
I gave 'em each 500 bucks
out of my own pocket.

87
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:19,003
- Thanks again, Doug.
- You the man, Doug.

88
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:21,072
Actually, I'd rather
still not be a hostage.

89
00:03:21,107 --> 00:03:22,607
Pam hasn't come around on me yet.

90
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:24,309
Tell her I'm a nice person, Jake.

91
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:26,044
I'm sorry. Officer, are you
friends with this criminal?

92
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,879
- No, not really.
- Absolutely, best friends.

93
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,380
It's a layered relationship, Pam.

94
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:31,682
- Best friends.
- Judy, get over here.

95
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:34,986
- What is going on, man?
- This isn't my fault.

96
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:37,956
Two years ago before I went straight,
I stole a car from a drug dealer.

97
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:40,358
- Martin Halloway.
- Oh, no, Judy, he's a bad guy.

98
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:42,093
I know. When I realized it was his car,

99
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:43,628
I torched it along with the drugs

100
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:45,463
that were in the trunk
that I didn't know about.

101
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:46,931
Oh, no, Judy. Trunk drugs?

102
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,233
Millions of dollars of them.

103
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:50,034
Halloway just found out it was me.

104
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,036
Said I had to do a job for him
to pay off my debt.

105
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:53,304
But did you tell him you went straight?

106
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:54,939
- Did you tell him about Dustin?
- I did.

107
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:56,741
He said he doesn't watch
"Stranger Things."

108
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:58,543
- Oh, this guy is the worst.
- I know.

109
00:03:58,578 --> 00:04:00,678
He said he's gonna kill my mom
if I don't do this job.

110
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:01,980
He can't do that. I love your mom.

111
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:03,881
So do I. That's why I'm here

112
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,783
stealing this big ole bag of diamonds.

113
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:07,819
Jake, you know how dangerous
this dude can be.

114
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:10,155
I need you to help me save my mama.

115
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,150
- Help you how?
- Easy.

116
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,686
I got a plan that's good for everyone.

117
00:04:13,722 --> 00:04:15,093
All I need is for you to...

118
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:17,228
Let him go so he can arrange
a drop with Halloway.

119
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:19,097
We arrest Halloway, save Judy's mom,

120
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,966
and Judy turns himself in,
and why is that amazing, Rosa?

121
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,868
- Halloway's a huge crime boss.
- And what else?

122
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:25,574
NYPD's been trying
to get Halloway for years.

123
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,639
- And?
- That's it.

124
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,072
Yeah, it is. So, since we all agree,

125
00:04:28,107 --> 00:04:29,507
I'll go tell Judy that the plan is on.

126
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,876
We don't all agree.
He's trapped and desperate.

127
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:33,545
Everything he told you is a lie.

128
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,114
- Why do you say he's lying?
- That's all negotiating is.

129
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,049
Two liars lying to each other

130
00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:40,351
until one liar stands
too close to the window

131
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:41,519
and gets shot in the head.

132
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:43,388
That can't be all negotiating is.

133
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:45,056
It absolutely is. Now, get in there

134
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:47,091
and coax him to a window.
Snipers to one.

135
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:48,526
The window plan is on. I repeat.

136
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:50,261
- The window plan is on.
- No, no, no, no, no!

137
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:52,196
Snipers to zero. Snipers take a nap.

138
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:54,365
The nap plan is on.
It's nap time, snipers.

139
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:57,635
Amy, Gina, you came!

140
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,571
You think I'd miss
opening day of your food truck?

141
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:02,106
- I'm your biggest fan.
- Also your biggest investor.

142
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,208
She was freaking out she was
gonna lose a ton of money.

143
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:05,777
I told you that in confidence.

144
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:07,278
We don't have that kind of relationship.

145
00:05:07,313 --> 00:05:09,380
Well, don't worry. I'm feeling good.

146
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:11,182
"The One Thing" truck is ready to serve.

147
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:12,483
- "The One Thing"?
- Yeah.

148
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:13,751
We only serve one thing:

149
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:15,787
the perfect meatball sandwich...

150
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:17,889
made exactly the way Nana Boyle used to.

151
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:19,791
I can't believe this
is finally happening.

152
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:24,505
- Ahh!
- Uh, Charles?

153
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,397
Sorry, I'm a bit stressed.
Jason and Jeff,

154
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:28,139
the guys I hired to work the truck,

155
00:05:28,175 --> 00:05:29,917
called in sick so I'm all alone.

156
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:31,386
What a fun opportunity.

157
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:33,425
Okay, Boyle, stop freaking out.

158
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:35,387
I have the day off.
I can step in and help.

159
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:38,270
Yeah, me too. I'm not off,
but I come and go as I please.

160
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,454
It's part of my charm.
I'm like an outdoor cat.

161
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:44,115
ESU won't take your deal.
They think you're lying.

162
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,284
I'm not lying.
I don't wanna be a criminal.

163
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,186
I love my life as a average citizen.

164
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:50,121
I voted for the first time this year.

165
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:52,165
- Ed Breakfast for school board.
- Who?

166
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,992
I don't know. He had a funny name.
He deserves a shot.

167
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:55,560
That's why I voted for Stacy Ladle.

168
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:57,428
Anyway, I'm sorry, but
they're not cutting a deal.

169
00:05:57,463 --> 00:05:59,130
So that's it? I gotta turn myself in

170
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,540
- and let Halloway kill my mama?
- Actually...

171
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,962
there might another way
to get this done.

172
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,462
I've taken your negotiator hostage.

173
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:08,665
If you come in here, I will shoot him.

174
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,010
Just do whatever he says!
My life is in his hands!

175
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:15,880
That was so much fun!

176
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:17,849
Oh, man, you sounded really scary.

177
00:06:17,884 --> 00:06:19,083
No, no, it was all you.

178
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:20,652
The tremble in your voice sold it.

179
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:22,720
- "Just do whatever he wants."
- I just made that up.

180
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:25,056
- Ah, I was so in the moment.
- Dude, seriously?

181
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:27,892
- You are a great hostage.
- Oh, thanks, Judy.

182
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:29,994
You're a great hostage taker. Whoop.

183
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,166
Yes, sir.

184
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:39,613
I can't believe Peralta
got taken hostage.

185
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,331
The good news is...

186
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:43,684
I'm the negotiator now.

187
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,085
- Finally.
- Congratulations.

188
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,254
I've been waiting
for this moment for so long,

189
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:48,749
- and...
<i>- I'm ready to negotiate.</i>

190
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:51,224
<i>But I'll only talk to Rosa Diaz.</i>

191
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:53,261
- That's me, Dennis.
- Oh, come on!

192
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,997
Okay, I think we're ready
for a practice sandwich.

193
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:58,932
- Sounds good, boss.
- Please call me "chef."

194
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,599
That's funny.

195
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,997
- Chef.
- Thank you.

196
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:07,007
Okay, see. The cut is a little slopey.

197
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,942
I want you to cut it straight across.

198
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:10,877
No big deal. Again.

199
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:11,927
Oh.

200
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:13,714
Uhp, slopey.

201
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:15,652
Don't over think it. Again.

202
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,685
Now you're not thinking enough.

203
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,786
Again.

204
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:22,083
Still slopey. Again.

205
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:23,457
Again!

206
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:24,857
You know what? Why don't we try this:

207
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:26,093
Why don't you just take that knife,

208
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:27,427
put it to my throat, and finish the job!

209
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:28,996
- Huh?
- Do I look like Jake to you?

210
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,364
- What?
- Do I look like Jake to you?

211
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,165
- No, not at all.
- Then why are you trying

212
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,167
- to screw me?
- Oh, my God, Charles,

213
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:36,403
- what is going on with you?
- It's chef.

214
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:38,171
You're not ready for this.
Gina, you're up.

215
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:39,539
Okay, but I'm not calling you chef,

216
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:41,572
- and you're not yelling at me.
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,012
- There you go.
- Ah, thank you.

218
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,547
No slope! A nice, straight cut!

219
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:49,082
Thank you.
I felt good 'cause the knife...

220
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:50,684
But you smushed the bread!

221
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,230
It's too smushy!

222
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:54,269
Again.

223
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:00,961
♪ Rosa, Rosa, Rosa ♪

224
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:02,831
♪ Are you finally single? ♪

225
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,498
- No.
- ♪ I respect that ♪

226
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,333
Now come on in. We gotta talk business.

227
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:09,022
It's so good to see you. Bring it in.

228
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:11,404
Doug Judy, you're under arrest.

229
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,073
- Wait, Rosa, stop.
- What's going on?

230
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,100
All right, look, this is not
really a hostage situation.

231
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:16,769
I mean, Pam and the two Bobs
are definitely being held

232
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:18,372
against their will,
but not for much longer.

233
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,011
Jake is helping me take down Halloway.

234
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:22,022
- We can't do it without you.
- Seriously, man?

235
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:24,150
This is like that story my dad
told me as a little kid.

236
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:25,519
You're the frog and he's a scorpion.

237
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:27,054
You're gonna help him across the river.

238
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,794
And in the end, he'll sting you,

239
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,450
- and then you'll both drown.
- Wow, that's dark.

240
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:32,953
My parents didn't read to me at all.

241
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:34,431
I just watched cartoons
till I fell asleep.

242
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:35,667
Do you think that our childhoods shape

243
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:37,097
- the adults we become?
- They do.

244
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:38,532
And cartoons shaped you
into a naive little frog.

245
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,267
Okay, first, little frogs are adorable,

246
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:42,069
and second, he's not
that kind of scorpion anymore.

247
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,437
I'm a changed bug.

248
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:44,704
Actually, scorpions are arthropods.

249
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:46,139
Amy made me watch a documentary.

250
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:48,279
Look, I know he used to be a criminal
and he's fooled me in the past,

251
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:50,243
and he is currently engaged
in criminal activity.

252
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:51,812
Innocent until proved guilty.

253
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:53,847
- But I am doing it.
- Rosa, his mother is in danger

254
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:55,582
and we have to help her.

255
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:57,384
Plus, he agreed to turn himself
in when this is all over.

256
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,257
- Right, Judy?
- I promise.

257
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:01,499
All right.

258
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,637
What do you need from me?

259
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:04,973
We have an airtight plan.

260
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,793
All we demand is pizza.

261
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:09,563
Hitchcock, there's a woman
here interviewing detectives

262
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:11,531
a part of the
Commissioner selection process.

263
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:13,200
All right, I'll go hide
in the janitor's closet

264
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:15,026
until this is all over.
Thanks for the heads up.

265
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:17,170
No, it's too late for that.
She wants to talk to you.

266
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:19,206
What? No! How could you let this happen?

267
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:21,308
- I'm nuts!
- Hey, calm down, man.

268
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:22,943
We just took her
on a tour of the precinct

269
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,612
and how she's at lunch.
That means we have one hour

270
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:28,148
to teach you how to behave like a human.

271
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:30,192
Oh, I see.

272
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:32,886
- You're gonna "My Bare Lady" me.
- "My Bare Lady"?

273
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:36,101
I'm assuming it's
a "My Fair Lady" porn parody.

274
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:39,292
Oh, my. We've got our work
cutout for us.

275
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,094
Here's our list of words to avoid:

276
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:43,363
Chick, foxy, Jew, throb.

277
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:44,998
Is grundle on the table?

278
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,266
No, it's not on the table.

279
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:48,668
Practice introducing yourself.

280
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:51,204
Hello, I'm Detective Michael Hitchcock.

281
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,706
Nice job.

282
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:54,875
- But why are your hands so wet?
- Trick question.

283
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,344
The answers disgusting,
so I shouldn't tell her.

284
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,279
Just don't have wet hands, man.

285
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:01,659
Hitchcock, come out.

286
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:03,628
It's time.

287
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:08,188
You look incredible.

288
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:09,283
You bet I do.

289
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,127
These pants really flatter my dong.

290
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,884
What? Dong wasn't on the list.

291
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:15,729
I cannot believe I didn't know

292
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:17,063
you and Amy were getting married.

293
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:18,565
Yeah, well, you're not exactly

294
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,433
- an easy person to find.
- Right, right, right.

295
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:21,767
I am elusive as hell.

296
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:24,689
So, is there a La Creuset pot

297
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,673
- on your registry, by chance?
- Of course.

298
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,375
You can cook and serve in them.

299
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,377
And it looks amazing on your shelf.

300
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,112
What's your color of preference?

301
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:33,547
French grey or mineral blue?

302
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:35,415
Oh, you really do know your Le Creuset.

303
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,683
French grey.

304
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:38,518
Mineral Blue makes me want to barf.

305
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:41,555
Consider it gifted.
Also, it would me my honor,

306
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,156
- to sing at your wedding.
- Yeah, I don't think

307
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:45,125
- that's gonna be possible.
- Oh, I get it.

308
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,426
You're afraid when I open my mouth.

309
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,295
Everyone's gonna
start smushing on sight.

310
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,297
No, I more meant that your
probably still gonna be in jail.

311
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,625
Damn, that's right.
I almost forgot. Tell you what.

312
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:53,967
I'll record you some songs.

313
00:10:54,002 --> 00:10:56,269
"Kiss From a Rose"
really exploits my range.

314
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:57,984
We have your food.

315
00:10:58,707 --> 00:11:00,974
Why are we sending him in?
One of my men should do it.

316
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:03,310
It would take two of
your people three trips each

317
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:04,945
to hold this much food. My guy's a pro.

318
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,711
I've been carrying takeout
since before you were born, son.

319
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:09,810
Fine, but I wanna know
what's going on in there.

320
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:11,876
We're putting a camera on him.

321
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,323
You're on camera. No audio.

322
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:17,757
Thought so. That's why I'm tied up.

323
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:19,492
Scully, where the pepper flakes?

324
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:21,428
Will you calm down?
The food's a diversion.

325
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:22,729
Although, Scully, it is crazy

326
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:24,197
that you forgot the pepper flakes.

327
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:25,398
Anyways, you know what to do now.

328
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,414
What I do best. Turn my heart off.

329
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:33,940
- What just happened?
- Looks like Scully collapsed.

330
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:35,308
<i>What the hell?</i>

331
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:36,843
<i>Your man just had a heart attack!</i>

332
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:37,893
<i>Send an ambulance!</i>

333
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:40,178
We're coming out.

334
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:43,550
Something doesn't feel right.

335
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:45,185
Why is there a sheet over his head?

336
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,753
Because that's not our guy.

337
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:48,320
- Judy's trying to escape.
- There's no way he could...

338
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:49,756
All units move on the ambulance now!

339
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,891
<i>- All units...</i>
- Move, move, move!

340
00:11:51,926 --> 00:11:53,592
Nice try, Judy.

341
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,062
- Hi, there.
- Nice work, Dennis,

342
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:58,365
you just caught a man
having a medical emergency.

343
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,000
Why was there a sheet over his head?

344
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:02,669
- Couldn't find his pulse.
- Yeah, it's super weak.

345
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:04,838
We got movement.
Hostages are coming out.

346
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:06,306
Hostages are coming out!

347
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:07,474
What the hell is going on?

348
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,276
Does anyone have eyes on Judy?

349
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,044
Where is Doug Judy?

350
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,713
So glad Scully put the
uniforms in with the pizza.

351
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:15,382
I keep finding hidden pepperonis.

352
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,684
Oh, man, all I got was
a pocket full of lettuce.

353
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:19,586
Jake, I got you.

354
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:21,596
Ooh, a garlic knot.

355
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:23,269
Okay, let's ride.

356
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:26,041
We'll be safe here. I know the owner.
He'd never turn me in.

357
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:28,400
Yeah, I have the exact same
relationship with the guy who runs

358
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:30,468
the laser tag place I love.
I mean, gun range.

359
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:33,238
Peralta, who you
out here stuntin' for, huh?

360
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:36,207
I love laser-T.
We gotta go sometime, man.

361
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:37,642
I was hoping you'd say that.

362
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:39,177
- I wasn't stunting.
- A little bit.

363
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:40,512
- A little stunting.
- You stunted.

364
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:42,246
A little bit.
All right, let's text Halloway

365
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:44,450
- and set up the drop.
- Okay, yeah.

366
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:46,684
Got the diamonds. Let's meet.

367
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,086
Done.

368
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:49,354
Okay, now we wait.

369
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:51,053
Now we wait.

370
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,767
Kind of weird, sitting silently

371
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:05,136
in a private karaoke room, not singing.

372
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:06,304
Yeah, but we're on a mission,

373
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:07,672
so, you know, gotta stay focused.

374
00:13:07,707 --> 00:13:11,242
True, true, true, true, true, true.

375
00:13:11,277 --> 00:13:13,077
♪ So I wake in the morning ♪

376
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:14,579

Uh-oh.

382
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:26,855
- Halloway.
- Yeah.

383
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,524
The drop is set for 5:00 p.m.

384
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:30,656
- Let's do this.
- Totally.

385
00:13:30,997 --> 00:13:33,698
Although... that is
an hour and a half from now.

386
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:35,667
And the drop point is
actually pretty close to here.

387
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:37,769
So...

388
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:42,440
♪ And I said hey yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

389
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:44,098
Order up, chef.

390
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,010
What is this? Why are you making

391
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:48,012
- six sandwiches at once?
- It's more efficient.

392
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:49,681
Now we're ready
for the next five customers.

393
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:51,749
Who gives a hump about efficiency?

394
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:53,418
The perfect meatball sandwich

395
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:56,554
is sauced exactly 70 seconds
before being served

396
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:57,769
to maintain bread integrity.

397
00:13:57,805 --> 00:13:59,991
So sandwich number one will be fine,

398
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:02,525
but sandwich number six
will be a soggy turd.

399
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:05,988
Change in menu.
We're serving soggy turds now!

400
00:14:06,024 --> 00:14:08,148
- Get 'em while they're wet.
- Okay, I quit.

401
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:09,934
Me too. You're insane.

402
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:12,270
Fine, quit just like Jeff and Jason did.

403
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:13,805
You told us they got sick.

404
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,940
They got sick of hard work
just like you two!

405
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,876
Get out! You'll never cook
in this town again!

406
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:19,944
- We're not chefs!
- And you never will be.

407
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:23,303
Is Hitchcock doing okay?

408
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,683
I think so. Wait.

409
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:27,629
He's bringing his hand to his face.

410
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:30,054
Don't pick your teeth.
Don't pick your nose.

411
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:33,057
Oh, dear, he's going to lick
something off his fingers.

412
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:35,772
Oh, no, he's stroking his chin.

413
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,258
As if in thought.

414
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:38,765
Not as if.

415
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:40,338
He is in thought.

416
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,166
Oop, they're looking at us. Act natural.

417
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:44,235
- Spreadsheet, spreadsheet.
- Crime, crime.

418
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,137
- Precinct, precinct.
- Yeah.

419
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:47,405
We swept the area.

420
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,274
No sign of Doug Judy or Peralta.

421
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,075
I can't believe that idiot thought

422
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,211
he could just waltz in here
and do my job.

423
00:14:53,246 --> 00:14:55,079
It's hard to be a negotiator!

424
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:58,182
My first 50 jumpers, 49 died.

425
00:14:58,217 --> 00:14:59,683
You only talked down one person?

426
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:02,473
No, he jumped too, but he landed
on this woman who broke his fall.

427
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:04,622
She died, but you can't
count that against me.

428
00:15:04,657 --> 00:15:06,558
- I definitely can.
- Yeah, well, save it.

429
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:08,626
Peralta's the one
who got himself taken hostage.

430
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,028
I don't think he was a hostage.

431
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:12,163
He's pretty good friends
with that Doug guy.

432
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:13,192
What?

433
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,713
Diaz, what the hell is going on?

434
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:17,769
First, a jeweler will come out
and inspect the diamonds.

435
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:19,103
Then, when he gives the okay,

436
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:20,204
Halloway will come and get them.

437
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,540
And then I'll take him down.

438
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:24,450
All right, that's the signal.
Here we go.

439
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:29,447
What's up, dude?

440
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:34,919
Anybody ever tell you, you look like

441
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:36,716
the most interesting man in the world?

442
00:15:37,277 --> 00:15:38,515
You get that a lot?

443
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,155
Jeez, I get it. We're not friends.

444
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,191
I'll find another bocce ball partner.

445
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:47,565
There he is. ♪ Halloway, it's your day ♪

446
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,866
What's up, Mr. Halloway. How you doing?

447
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:50,868
Shut up. Give me the diamonds.

448
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:52,870
Man, I guess the no-small-talk policy

449
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:55,039
- starts at the top.
- Come on, come on, come on.

450
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:57,308
- Peralta!
- No, no, no, not now.

451
00:15:57,343 --> 00:15:58,610
I tracked your phone, idiot.

452
00:15:58,645 --> 00:15:59,943
Judy wasn't lying.

453
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:01,445
That's Halloway. We gotta arrest him.

454
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:03,014
- Jake, he's running.
- Come on, man.

455
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,816
Only if I get the collar
and 100% of the credit.

456
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:06,283
Are you negotiating right now?

457
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,752
Always.

458
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:09,486
Okay, that was actually
a really cool thing to say.

459
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:11,311
All right, let's do it. Judy, stay here.

460
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:12,472
Okay.

461
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:14,882
Stop!

462
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:19,497
Sorry I ran out on you
at the jewelry store.

463
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:20,732
I just couldn't let this guys get away.

464
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:22,100
Look, man, I'm fine with it.

465
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:24,202
Arresting Halloway's
gonna get me a promotion,

466
00:16:24,237 --> 00:16:26,504
and at the end of the day,
that's what this is all about.

467
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:29,273
Right, well, that and getting
a major drug lord off the streets.

468
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:31,643
Let me give you some advice.
I don't care about that.

469
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:33,111
You know, you should really
look up the word advice.

470
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:34,578
I think you might be surprised
what you see.

471
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:36,347
All right, let's bring in Doug Judy.

472
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:37,782
Oh, no!

473
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:39,851
Where is he? Doug?

474
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:41,386
Don't worry. We'll get him.

475
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:42,587
At least we have Halloway
and the diamonds.

476
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:43,855
- Doug!
- Wait, why are you

477
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,823
- still calling for him?
- Doug!

478
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:48,426
Oh, my God, he has
the diamonds, doesn't he?

479
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:51,562
Doug!

480
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:54,747
I'm sure Judy didn't run off
with the diamonds.

481
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:56,282
I bet he's looking for us right now.

482
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:57,817
You know what, I bet he's
worried that we're in trouble.

483
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:59,318
I'll just call him
and put his mind at ease.

484
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,494
Dude, he's already gone.
He's not picking up.

485
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:03,522
<i>- What's up, Peralta.</i>
- Ha!

486
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:04,857
He did pick up. In your...

487
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,792
- This is good-bye forever.
- No!

488
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:09,095
Ugh, I can't believe you deceived me.

489
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,730
I can't believe you used
my love for your mother

490
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:12,265
- against me.
- I love that you love her.

491
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,000
Of course I do. She's a living saint.

492
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:16,002
<i>Amen. Look, I wasn't lying though.</i>

493
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:18,097
Halloway was gonna hurt her
and you saved her life,

494
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:19,872
<i>but then I was all alone
with the diamonds,</i>

495
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:21,774
next thing I know, I'm hot
wiring a car and driving away.

496
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:24,010
Oh, but I thought you liked
being a good citizen?

497
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:25,745
You voted Ed Breakfast for school board.

498
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,980
And he immediately had a sex scandal.

499
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:29,715
- It was very disillusioning.
- For sure.

500
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,118
Our democracy is crumbling.
But what about your job?

501
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:33,583
What about Dustin
from "Stranger Things"?

502
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,919
Famous kids are monsters.

503
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:36,335
You do not wanna meet Young Sheldon.

504
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,201
Really? Ah, that's disappointing.
He was so good in "Big Little Lies."

505
00:17:39,237 --> 00:17:41,093
Wait, no, we are not
talking about this right now!

506
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:42,662
They could take my badge, Judy!

507
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:44,884
I guess Rosa was right. I'm scorpion.

508
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:46,662
Scorpion's gonna scorp.

509
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,668
I'm sorry I can't be the man
you want me to be.

510
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:50,269
<i>Damn it, stop being so romantic.</i>

511
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:52,706
Now turn around
and come back to me, you fool?

512
00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:54,230
Hello? Hello?

513
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:55,448
He's gone.

514
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:57,151
He broke my heart.

515
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,346
Now's the time where you tell
me everything's gonna be okay.

516
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:02,922
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- You don't know that, Rosa!

517
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,018
Ah, Hitchcock, I just got off
the phone with Anne Sumter.

518
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,987
She said you really helped my candidacy.

519
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:10,456
- Oh, it's my pleasure, sir.
- You were so professional.

520
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:12,618
I know. I didn't even fart once.

521
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:14,215
You're right. I can hold it.

522
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:16,195
You know, if you can
change for an interview,

523
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,864
- you can change for good.
- Nah, too much work.

524
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:21,067
But that's not how "My Fair Lady" ends.

525
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:23,573
Eliza Doolittle doesn't
go back to her old life.

526
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:25,376
She falls in love with Henry Higgins.

527
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:27,540
Well, "My Bare Lady,"
is a little different.

528
00:18:27,575 --> 00:18:29,675
It's not Eliza Doolittle
and Henry Higgins.

529
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,345
It's Eliza DooEverybody and Leroy Pipe.

530
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,713
And in the end, they rub...

531
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,314
Nope. We don't need a recap.

532
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,434
- Thank you for your help today.
- Anytime, Captain.

533
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,253
Hey, guys. Uh, can we talk?

534
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,022
Let me guess, you got overwhelmed

535
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:44,790
and had to use
our six-sandwich technique.

536
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:46,826
No, my one at a time system
worked perfectly.

537
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,160
- Oh.
- It's just,

538
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,029
making Nana Boyle's meatball recipe

539
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:52,131
got me thinking a lot about her...

540
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,367
And let me guess,
you realized she'd be ashamed

541
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:56,836
- of how you acted?
- No, Nana Boyle was a monster.

542
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:58,571
She once yelled at me so loud,
I fainted.

543
00:18:58,606 --> 00:18:59,788
She was a hateful witch.

544
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:01,307
- She died with no friends.
- And let me guess,

545
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:04,322
you realized you were acting
just like her and you felt terrible.

546
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:05,878
- Yes.
- You see, Amy?

547
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,713
You don't do "and let me guess"

548
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:09,115
until you're sure you're right.

549
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,016
Can you guys forgive me? Please?

550
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,385
Of course, Charles.

551
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,086
But we will never work for you again.

552
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,522
Yeah, that's a smart move.
It's like Jekyll and Hyde.

553
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,157
I can't control when Nana comes out.

554
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:19,592
Just got off the phone with the brass.

555
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:20,960
It doesn't look good.

556
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:22,328
They're still trying to decide
on a punishment

557
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:23,763
- for your actions.
- Well, did you tell them

558
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:24,997
I feel so bad I have a tummy ache?

559
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:26,399
I did. They were unaffected.

560
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:28,100
They said they could have
justified your tactics

561
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:30,136
if you'd come away
with Halloway and the diamonds,

562
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:32,104
but as things stand,
there are no diamonds.

563
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:33,739
Well, there are some diamonds.

564
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:35,374
You know, the tops of engagement rings,

565
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,209
diamond mines, but, yes,
I see what you're saying

566
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,445
in regards to these diamonds
and it ruining my career.

567
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,213
You're looking at
a suspension, maybe worse.

568
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,851
Unless you can track down Doug Judy

569
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:45,184
- and recover those diamonds.
- Can they wait 12 months?

570
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,975
I usually run into him
about once a year.

571
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:50,015
Wait a minute. What have we here?

572
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:52,915
I've got this coupon for a private room.

573
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:56,030
Yes. Right this way.

574
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,387
We already have a song cued up for you.

575
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:02,401
Judy.

576
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:05,304
<i>What's up, Peralta?
Thank you so much for coming.</i>

577
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,941
<i>Look, I thought about it
and I did you dirty.</i>

578
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:10,643
<i>I never meant to cause you any trouble.</i>

579
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:12,044
Yeah, well, you caused me a lot.

580
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,706
<i>You're talking to a pre-recorded video,</i>

581
00:20:13,742 --> 00:20:15,548
<i>but it's cool.
I know what you're saying.</i>

582
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,683
<i>- I hear you in my heart.</i>
- What am I doing here?

583
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,486
<i>I feel the same way.
You my best friend too.</i>

584
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,087
<i>Look, I'm not coming back.</i>

585
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:23,722
<i>I started a new life here in San Diego.</i>

586
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:25,257
Stupid telling me where you are.

587
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:27,159
<i>Come on, man,
I ain't in no damn San Diego.</i>

588
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,061
<i>Everybody knows that place sucks!</i>

589
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,388
<i>Here's what I wanna say, though:</i>

590
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:32,465
<i>I'm sorry I won't be at your wedding.</i>

591
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,236
<i>But I did record you a CD
of original smush jams</i>

592
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:39,238
<i>that will consummate the marriage.</i>

593
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:40,906
<i>It's on the table next to you</i>

594
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:42,544
<i>along with a little something else.</i>

595
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,513
A French grey Le Creuset pot.

596
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,269
<i>Now look inside it.</i>

597
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:51,784
The diamonds.

598
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:54,153
Yes! I cannot believe you actually

599
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,622
- brought them back...
<i>- The diamonds!</i>

600
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:58,958
- Yeah, mistimed that one.
<i>- No, you're the best.</i>

601
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:01,093
<i>Look, even though I am a scorpion,</i>

602
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:04,597
<i>I will never drown
your adorable little frog ass.</i>

603
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,065
<i>So that's what I had to say.</i>

604
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,868
<i>I'm sure I'll see you again
at some point.</i>

605
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:10,369
<i>Now that coupon you got there,</i>

606
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:12,524
<i>that's for a full hour
in a private room.</i>

607
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,208
- <i>so...</i>

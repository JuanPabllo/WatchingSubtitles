1
00:00:02,607 --> 00:00:04,050
- Pigeon's still here?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:05,623
No matter what we do,
he just won't leave.

3
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:07,358
The problem is you're
thinking like detectives.

4
00:00:07,393 --> 00:00:08,860
- No, I'm definitely not.
- When you should

5
00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:10,446
be thinking like a bird.

6
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:14,165
- _
- This is Operation: Saving Private Pigeon.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,234
On my mark, I will turn on this fan,

8
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:18,469
gently startling our bird due east,

9
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:20,338
into the file box canyon, where he will

10
00:00:20,373 --> 00:00:22,607
encounter Charles holding two pot lids.

11
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:23,960
He'll bang them together,

12
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:26,163
forcing Private Pigeon
into the ceiling there

13
00:00:26,198 --> 00:00:27,685
and out of the ceiling there,

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,688
where he will be greeted by scary Rosa

15
00:00:29,723 --> 00:00:31,315
holding a scary picture of an owl.

16
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,783
Now he's playing our game.

17
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:35,319
He'll veer left, into an
upside down garbage can

18
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:36,580
propped up by a hockey stick

19
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:38,248
and connected to a string
that Gina is holding.

20
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:39,690
She pulls it, he is trapped,

21
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:41,425
and Terry releases him outside.

22
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,752
- Terry hates birds.
- Okay, little friend.

23
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:45,642
Let's get you home to mama.

24
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:50,601
Oh, God. It flew right into the fan!

25
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:53,404
It's everywhere!
There's pigeon everywhere!

26
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:12,406

27
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:15,226
- Hey, Boyle.
- Hey, Jake.

28
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:16,339
- Wait, what?
- Hey, Jake.

29
00:01:16,374 --> 00:01:18,185
Ahh! Bill, what are you doing here?

30
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,254
I thought we agreed to meet only
once a year for the Halloween Heist.

31
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,533
I'm here to deliver
your quarterly NutriBoom shipment.

32
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:24,569
It comes with both
the amino acid reducer

33
00:01:24,604 --> 00:01:27,030
and extra amino acid,
so you get the perfect balance.

34
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:29,574
What? No. I only signed up
as a one-time payment bribe.

35
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:31,976
I'm not selling NutriBoom.
It's clearly a pyramid scheme.

36
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:34,334
First off, it's not a pyramid scheme.

37
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:36,113
It's a conical-tiered multi-flow-through

38
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:37,196
medical marketing entity.

39
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,563
And secondly, you signed the contract.

40
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,484
"Permission to charge my card quarterly

41
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,245
for the next 85 years."

42
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,055
This is written in white
ink on white paper.

43
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,756
They do it that way
so you can't read it.

44
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,558
Well, I did read it
and I'm canceling the contract.

45
00:01:47,593 --> 00:01:49,067
Canceling? If it was that easy
to get out,

46
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:51,162
would I be here scamming
my closest friends?

47
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:52,468
We're your closest friends?

48
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:54,049
What... whatever,
I'm not accepting the shipment.

49
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:55,833
Jake, piece of advice: just give up.

50
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:57,702
It's the Boyle way.
It's why our family crest

51
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:59,270
- is a white flag.
- That reminds me, Charles,

52
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:00,671
- your shipment's downstairs.
- Great.

53
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:02,206
- I'll help you bring it up.
- Charles, no.

54
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:04,208
We're gonna go down to that
office and fight this thing.

55
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:05,676
I need that money for my honeymoon.

56
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:07,545
Oh, my God.
The honeymoon is on the line?

57
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,046
- And your money.
- Eh.

58
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:10,448
Okay, great. Whatever gets you onboard.

59
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:11,683
- Let's go.
- For the honeymoon

60
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:12,716
- and no other reason.
- All right.

61
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:14,185
Sergeant Santiago,

62
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,153
commander of the Nine-Nine's
uniformed officers,

63
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:18,436
- reporting for duty.
- Hey!

64
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:21,846
My first order as Sergeant,
tell me I look dope.

65
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:23,479
- You look dope.
- You won't be abusing

66
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:25,630
your power like this with the
officers downstairs, will you?

67
00:02:25,665 --> 00:02:27,331
No! No, of course not.

68
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:28,799
I'm just excited for my first day.

69
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:30,401
Yes, I remember my first day
as a sergeant.

70
00:02:30,436 --> 00:02:31,669
- I bet.
- My Uncle Geoffrey

71
00:02:31,704 --> 00:02:33,812
was struck by a subway and maimed.

72
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,340
- Oh.
- But the work aspect

73
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,483
was quite exciting.

74
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:38,809
Are you ready for your first briefing?

75
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:41,012
Yes, I am fully prepared.

76
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,681
I just wanna establish myself
as a leader right away.

77
00:02:43,716 --> 00:02:46,317
Just be confident, deliberate and firm.

78
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:47,485
You'll know you have their respect

79
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,959
when you can take a moment...

80
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,339
and still keep their attention.

81
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:59,530
- Amazing.
- That was captivating as hell.

82
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:01,165
My recommendation would be
you start with

83
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
a small, attainable goal...

84
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:03,701
something you can accomplish quickly,

85
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:05,269
perfectly and publicly.

86
00:03:05,304 --> 00:03:08,921
The best way to lead is to
always achieve all your goals.

87
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:12,243
Cool. That's not a ton of pressure.

88
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:14,578
Well, it was meant to be. Pressure's
an important part of success.

89
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:16,714
Just remember, you represent

90
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:18,788
all Latina policewomen right now.

91
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:21,105
Thanks.

92
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:23,245
_

93
00:03:23,723 --> 00:03:26,023
Hello. Welcome to NutriServices.

94
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:28,492
I'm Angela. How can I heal you today?

95
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:30,028
Hi, Angela. Creepy greeting.

96
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:31,530
So not a big deal, there was just

97
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:34,398
a little bit of a mix-up and we
need to cancel our NutriContracts.

98
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,667
Absolutely. It happens all the time.

99
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,451
All you need to do is sign a few things.

100
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:40,671
Ah. See, Charles,
that is why you never give up.

101
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:42,707
- I'll also need $10,000.
- What's that? I'm sorry.

102
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:44,142
It's payment for the last shipment.

103
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:45,877
Plus the cancellation fee,
plus the restocking fee

104
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:48,112
plus something we call
a coward's charge.

105
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:49,847
And that comes to $10,000.

106
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:51,349
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

107
00:03:51,384 --> 00:03:53,551
I'll write you a check.
Is gratuity included?

108
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:54,472
Charles, no.

109
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:55,874
- Angela...
- Yes? How can I

110
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:57,254
- heal you today?
- Please stop saying that.

111
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:58,790
Look, you seem like a perfectly pleasant

112
00:03:58,825 --> 00:03:59,958
robot person, but there's no way

113
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:01,125
we're giving you any more money.

114
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,627
Ohh. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

115
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:06,864
For the no payment option,
you just need to sign here.

116
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:08,566
"Enrollment in NutriCore"?

117
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:09,967
It's our charity organization.

118
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:11,736
"Pay off your contracts in labor hours

119
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,572
under the teachings of founder
Docter David Stovelman."

120
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:16,141
"Docter" is spelled with an E?

121
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:18,250
- It's the British spelling.
- That can't be right.

122
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:20,611
All right, look. I didn't
wanna have to do this,

123
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:22,680
but we're in the NYPD.

124
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:24,415
And if you don't cooperate,
we'll have no choice

125
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,750
but to file a report
against the company.

126
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:27,918
You signed a contract,
and that is binding.

127
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:29,954
No one gets special treatment, Officer.

128
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:31,522
- Not even Jay.
- Who?

129
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:33,224
Jay Chandrasekhar,
their celebrity spokesman.

130
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:34,825
Oh, no way.
The guy from "Super Troopers"?

131
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,627
Yep. He was also in "Beerfest."

132
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:38,196
Now I have to get back to work,

133
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:40,965
but allow me to introduce you
to our complaint specialist.

134
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,335
This is Phil. He's been
assigned to intimidate you.

135
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,870
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!

136
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,505
Charles, stop thanking her.

137
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:51,910
Hello, squad. I am Sergeant Amy Santiago

138
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:53,812
and I'm your new commanding officer.

139
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:56,380
I have big plans for us,
but it's always best

140
00:04:56,415 --> 00:04:59,513
to start with something small
and do it perfectly.

141
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:00,676
So...

142
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,424
Sergeant, I know what
we should start with.

143
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:09,260
- Oh, I'm sorry, Officer...
- Jennings. Gary Jennings.

144
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:11,228
Officer Jennings, I already have a plan.

145
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,830
Okay, well, you just paused,
so I thought

146
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:14,064
you were looking for suggestions,

147
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,299
- which I have a lot of.
- Nope.

148
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:16,559
Not why I paused.

149
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:19,603
Anyway, our first order
of business will be

150
00:05:19,638 --> 00:05:22,196
updating the filing system, so...

151
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,577
- We should use barcodes.
- No, no, no, no.

152
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:27,912
No need to jump in.

153
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:29,246
I already have a system in mind.

154
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:30,748
Okay, well you just keep stopping,

155
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:32,049
- so I thought...
- Ah... to pour water.

156
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:34,018
- Because I'm thirsty.
- Got it. Great.

157
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:37,521
Now, let's get into
the details of this with...

158
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:38,923
Oh, my God! What, Gary?

159
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,834
You're spilling water everywhere.

160
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:44,213
Yes, I am.

161
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:46,297
Because our first order of business

162
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:48,137
is cleaning this floor.

163
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:50,668
Charles! Charles, come here.

164
00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:51,936
I figured out how to get our money back.

165
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:53,415
I knew you'd save our honeymoon.

166
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:54,839
- My honeymoon.
- Whatever.

167
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:56,140
Yeah, all right, so NutriBoom

168
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:57,942
is a massive financial scam, right?

169
00:05:57,977 --> 00:05:59,810
If we can prove that, we could
take down the whole company.

170
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:01,312
Oh, I don't know. Are you
sure you wanna take them on?

171
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:03,280
They're pretty scary.
I mean, no one's seen

172
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:04,681
the CEO's wife in years.

173
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:06,183
People think she's been murdered.

174
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:07,518
That's just a rumor.
All right, here's the plan:

175
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,819
we infiltrate their headquarters

176
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:10,287
and get their financial records.

177
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:11,889
But how do we get in, you ask?

178
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:13,958
By attending today's meeting
of President's Club

179
00:06:13,993 --> 00:06:15,426
Admiral Level NutriMasters

180
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:17,094
- at the NutriTower Life Base.
- I don't know,

181
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:18,662
they know we're cops,
we can't just walk in.

182
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:20,130
Correct. We can't walk right in,

183
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:21,932
but we know someone who's a high-level

184
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,467
NutriBoom distributor who can.

185
00:06:23,502 --> 00:06:25,069
And he look exactly like you.

186
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:26,637
- Hey, guys.
- I don't know.

187
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:27,838
You really think it'll work?

188
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:29,073
Charles, it has to.

189
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:31,609
It's for our honeymoon.

190
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:33,210
You said "our."

191
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:39,389
Okay, the meeting
at NutriBoom HQ starts in two hours.

192
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:40,791
Charles, you're going as Bill

193
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,492
and I'm going as one
of your NutriCruits.

194
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,894
Bill, did you bring
those things I asked for?

195
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:45,096
Yep, all of my belongings
that you'll need

196
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:46,732
are in this suitcase.

197
00:06:48,837 --> 00:06:50,871
Why is it vibrating?
Is your cell phone in here?

198
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:53,588
- No.
- I'm sure it's not a sex toy.

199
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:54,605
All right, these people
really know Bill,

200
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,206
so you're gonna have to become him.

201
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,574
I can't believe I'm about to say this,

202
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:59,549
but Bill, tell us all about yourself.

203
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,811
Let's start with
my whole family history.

204
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,130
I was abandoned
at a playground as an infant.

205
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:05,448
And here I am.

206
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,073
Oh. That was the whole thing.

207
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,020
Well, sad. But easier than remembering
a bunch of names.

208
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,792
Okay, tell us more.

209
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:13,390
Now, here's a list of all
the nicknames I go by.

210
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:16,442
Big Bill, Big Eric, Big Drew,
Big Dave, Super Thick...

211
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,894
Just write them all down for us.

212
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:20,672
And that's why the number
of belly buttons I have is...

213
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:21,940
- Two.
- One.

214
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,905
- Zero.
- Ahh.

215
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,129
Hello.

216
00:07:25,164 --> 00:07:31,105
- Hello.
- Hello.

217
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,330
That's it. Okay, now
let's work on your wink.

218
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,950
Almost. Now think,

219
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:40,075
only you and I know
our naughty little secret.

220
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:42,189
Mmm-hmm.

221
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,141
Okay, I think Boyle's ready.

222
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:45,328
That's a no-go, Amigo.

223
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:46,600
If you really wanna pass as me,

224
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:47,931
you're gonna need to learn my patented

225
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:49,026
neck massage technique.

226
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:50,318
I think I've learned enough.

227
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:51,461
Yeah, I don't really see that coming up.

228
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:52,888
Thanks for your help, Bill.

229
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,407
So how did your
first briefing go, Sergeant?

230
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,143
Did you give the squad a simple goal?

231
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:59,208
Mm-hmm. Revamping the filing system.

232
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:01,414
Mm, smart. Sounds very easy.

233
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:02,912
- Mm.
- I assume it's been a success?

234
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:05,542
Oh... Yes. It's been...

235
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,518
all types of successes.

236
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,813
Rousing, resounding...

237
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:11,615
smashing.

238
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,439
Oh, it's good to hear.
Remember, failure...

239
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,119
is for failures.

240
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:17,674
Good thing I'm not a failure.

241
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,655
Guys, I lied. My briefing
was a total failure.

242
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,026
But you told Captain Holt it went great

243
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:24,675
in such a normal way.

244
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,177
I'm a terrible manager.

245
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:28,761
I've got this super eager
know-it-all on my squad

246
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:30,606
who keeps derailing
me with all his ideas

247
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:31,866
and I can't get anything done.

248
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:33,292
Aww, you got an Amy.

249
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,887
- Oh, she's got an Amy.
- It's pretty normal.

250
00:08:34,922 --> 00:08:36,222
Yeah, she got one of her, right?

251
00:08:36,257 --> 00:08:37,590
Like a pet. Takes one to know one,

252
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,859
- I guess.
- No, he is not an Amy.

253
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,361
I am nothing like Gary.

254
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,962
Uhh, first of all, Gary and Amy

255
00:08:42,997 --> 00:08:44,964
- are the exact same name.
- Let me ask you this:

256
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,000
did he already send you
nine follow-up emails

257
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:48,691
- about the briefing?
- No.

258
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:50,904
- It was 30.
- You got an Amy.

259
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:53,974
Guys, I think I would know
if my Gary was an Amy.

260
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:56,509
- Hey, Gary. What you reading?
- The new issue

261
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:57,778
of "Stationary Monthly."

262
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:58,950
Yeah, I have an Amy.

263
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,413
_

264
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:01,915
Bill. Is that you?

265
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,533
Yes, it's me, Bill. Hello.

266
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,220
- You seem different.
- Nope.

267
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,101
I'm still the same old Bill Hummertrout

268
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,890
who grew up in Bean Station, Tennessee

269
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,032
and shaves his armpits.

270
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,927
Anyway, meet the new recruit
I signed up.

271
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:15,395
New NutriCruit? Boom, boom!

272
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,263
Boom, boom. My name is Barry St. Barry.

273
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:20,166
And I can't wait to get inside
and unlock my NutriFuture.

274
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,734
Let me... let me in! Let me in!

275
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,003
I love your energy. Boom, boom!

276
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:25,606
I love your energy. Boom, boom!

277
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:27,652
Okay, get up there.

278
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:30,243
Man, everybody here is so creepy.

279
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,565
Yeah. Is that Hitchcock and Scully?

280
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:35,448
- Boom, boom, Bill!
- Boom, boom!

281
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:36,616
Yeah, that tracks.

282
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:38,184
All right, let's get a move on.

283
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,686
The longer I stay here,
the more horrified I get.

284
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:40,954
I know. Have you seen all these posters

285
00:09:40,989 --> 00:09:42,796
of David Stovelman's wife, Debby?

286
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,091
"I'm happy healthy and alive."

287
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,227
- Oh, Debbie dead.
- Debbie real dead.

288
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:48,761
All right, Bill said that the offices

289
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,063
are behind that roped-off area.

290
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:51,564
We're gonna need a distraction.

291
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,299
Well, if I know cults,
this meeting will start

292
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:55,368
with an insanely over-the-top
nonsense video.

293
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:56,937
- Huh.
<i>- Hello, Admirals.</i>

294
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,472
<i>Please turn your eyes to the monitors</i>

295
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:00,507
<i>for a special hello
from NutriBoom elite,</i>

296
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:01,508
<i>Jay Chandrasekhar.</i>

297
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:03,443
<i>Boom, boom, everybody!</i>

298
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,212
Boom, boom, Jay!

299
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:06,714
- And there's our distraction.
<i>- When I first met</i>

300
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,250
<i>Docter David Stovelman,</i>

301
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:10,984
<i>I had no idea my amino acids
could be so high</i>

302
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:12,934
<i>or so low.</i>

303
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:14,954
Ugh, guys.

304
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,990
Gary is killing my productivity.

305
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,425
Terry, how did you used to deal
with having an Amy?

306
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,761
I didn't have to do anything.
You've always been great.

307
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,296
Cut the crap, Terry. I'm drowning.

308
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,565
Fine. When you got
too difficult to deal with,

309
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,729
I'd pull rank.

310
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,169
- Did that work?
- No. Not even once.

311
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:30,837
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

312
00:10:30,872 --> 00:10:32,105
Well, you could always
just wait for Gary

313
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,607
to find his Jake and then eventually,

314
00:10:33,642 --> 00:10:35,810
over time, they'll each become
10% easier to deal with.

315
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,378
Gary will never find love.

316
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:38,746
He is unlovable.

317
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:40,415
- Gina, what do I do?
- No, I don't know

318
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,583
how to deal with an Amy.

319
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:45,051
But there is this girl Wanda
in my Mommy & Me class.

320
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:47,954
She's such a pill.
She's so into her baby

321
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:49,989
and not into the other babies
and it's like,

322
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,257
oh, cool, well, congrats.

323
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:52,793
Your baby rolled over early.

324
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:54,229
- Like, who cares?
- I don't have time

325
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:56,766
- for this, Gina.
- And that is how

326
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:58,235
you deal with an Amy.

327
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,970
You talk about something
she's not interested in

328
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:03,349
- until she walks away.
- Ohh, brilliant.

329
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,505
Stupid cult.

330
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,907
They labeled their financial
records "financial records."

331
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:09,156
Dummies.

332
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,145
Uh-oh, Jake. We got a NutriBoomer

333
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,479
approaching at 12:00.

334
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:14,804
The file just started downloading.

335
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,073
- How much time do we have?
- I don't know,

336
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,440
- but he's a polka dotter.
- Polka Dotter...

337
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,310
- what does that mean?
- Of the eight types of walkers?

338
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,111
Polka dotters, drivers, arm swingers,

339
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:22,647
stompers... you don't know about this?

340
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,964
Nobody does, Charles. You clearly
just read some weird blog post.

341
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,192
First of all, Popmango.com
is not a weird blog.

342
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:28,227
It's infotainment.

343
00:11:28,262 --> 00:11:29,562
Secondly, polka dot walkers

344
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:30,683
take short strides on their toes.

345
00:11:30,718 --> 00:11:32,194
I don't wanna learn
about polka dotters right now.

346
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:33,163
Just get out there and stall him.

347
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:34,130
But... gah!

348
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,636
Hello, bud. Boom, boom.

349
00:11:36,671 --> 00:11:38,138
Boom, boom. Bill.

350
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:39,306
What are you doing back here?

351
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:40,908
This floor's closed on the weekend.

352
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:42,809
You know me, just gotta stretch my legs.

353
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,344
I'm really sore from Pilates.

354
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,045
But NutriBoom doesn't allow Pilates.

355
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,513
It's a pseudoscience.

356
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,783
Right, no. Pilates is the name of my

357
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:52,485
most recent sexual partner.

358
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,620
Boom, boom!

359
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,288
Boom, boom. You seem off, man.

360
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:57,190
Your voice is different,
you're not sucking on

361
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,108
- your signature lollipop.
- Right.

362
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:01,961
I guess I just woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

363
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:03,529
Since when do you sleep in a bed?

364
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:04,731
Why are you being so weird?

365
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,056
What are you doing back here?

366
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,729
I know what's going on.

367
00:12:08,236 --> 00:12:10,570
You're fishing for one of
my patented neck massages,

368
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:11,488
aren't you?

369
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,440
- There's the Bill I know.
- Present and accounted for.

370
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:17,637
Now turn around and gimme me that neck.

371
00:12:19,247 --> 00:12:20,713
You're not gonna do it from the front?

372
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:23,537
Well, of course. I mean,
that's how I do it.

373
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,289
Oh, that's the good stuff. Boom, boom.

374
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:30,423
Boom, boom.

375
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:34,690
Hey, where's my eye contact?

376
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:38,298
I got the files.

377
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,832
I told you it would work.

378
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:42,567
- Wait, what's wrong?
- They formed a line, Jake.

379
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:45,200
They formed a line.

380
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:51,685
Ugh... No evidence of wrong
doing in any of these files.

381
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:53,190
Credit where credit is due,

382
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:54,792
NutriBoom is good at criminal activity.

383
00:12:54,827 --> 00:12:56,460
Well, they're terrible at making shakes.

384
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:59,364
Right? The only listed ingredient
is "foreign substance."

385
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,244
And the flavor is called
"Almost Cherry."

386
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:03,935
And I can't stop drinking it.

387
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:06,302
This is interesting.
There's a major transaction

388
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:07,670
- on June 10th.
- My dad's birthday!

389
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:09,206
You really think that's what I thought

390
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:10,641
- was interesting about it?
- I don't know.

391
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:12,476
It's a payment for
100 grand to ScepterCore.

392
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:14,445
Isn't that one of those
black ops security firms

393
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:16,346
- that ex-SEALs worked for?
- Yes, it is.

394
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:18,082
- And on June 10th...
- My dad's birthday.

395
00:13:18,117 --> 00:13:20,279
Are you just trying to get me to
remember your dad's birthday now?

396
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:21,287
I mean, it wouldn't kill you to call.

397
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:22,683
We don't have time to talk about this.

398
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,653
Your dad's birthday is the same day

399
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:26,323
that Debbie Stovelman
went missing last year.

400
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:27,992
I bet the payment is a paper trail

401
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:30,094
for the hit Stovelman
took out on his wife.

402
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:31,595
This just became a murder case.

403
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,597
Maybe, but it's not enough
to open an investigation.

404
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:35,833
Right, but it is enough
to make Stovelman nervous.

405
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:37,480
- We just have to get to him.
- Oh, no.

406
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:39,136
Do I have to go as Bill again?

407
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:40,337
No, don't worry. He isn't big enough

408
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,939
to earn face time with the founder.

409
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:43,589
We have to take this
to the highest level.

410
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:45,771
Jay Chandrasekhar!

411
00:13:46,912 --> 00:13:48,345
Hey, Gina. Thanks for nothin'!

412
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,681
- Oh, you're welcome.
- I said, for nothin'.

413
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:52,683
Your boring story didn't work.

414
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:55,986
So my friend Wanda,
she just loves the oceans.

415
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,889
The Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian...

416
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:01,892
Ooh, ooh! What is her take on straits?

417
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:03,405
Because I love the Bering.

418
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:06,196
We talked about
bodies of water for hours.

419
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:08,933
Damn, the Force is strong with this Amy.

420
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:10,200
Look, I wasn't gonna tell you this,

421
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:11,702
but you should just do what I used to do

422
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:13,470
- when I needed to escape you.
- What did you do?

423
00:14:13,505 --> 00:14:15,306
Literally escape you.
Always be on the move.

424
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:16,607
Never be static. Like a shark.

425
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:18,075
That way he can't catch your attention.

426
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,277
That's right! That is what we did.

427
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:22,012
- But you all did that?
- Mm-hmm.

428
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:24,048
Okay, but Rosa, how did you...

429
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,197
Rosa? W-where did she...

430
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:29,350
Damn, you guys are good.

431
00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:32,156
There he is. How did you know
he'd be at this coffee shop?

432
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,391
"US Weekly." He's pictured
here all the time.

433
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:35,993
He's coming out. All right, look,

434
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,160
this guy is into NutriBoom pretty deep.

435
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:39,563
But if we apply enough pressure,
we may get him to crack.

436
00:14:39,598 --> 00:14:40,631
Copy that.

437
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,898
Hi, excuse me.

438
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:43,434
Mr. Chandrasekhar,
we wanted to talk to you

439
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:45,035
- about NutriBoom.
- All right!

440
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,804
- Boom, boom, guys.
- Boom, boom!

441
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:49,106
- We're with the NYPD.
- Oh, my God. Seriously?

442
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:50,161
You guys have to save me.

443
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:51,308
- Can you get me out?
- What's that now?

444
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:52,879
NutriBoom is a scam and a cult.

445
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:54,345
- They've ruined my life.
- Really?

446
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,913
You look so happy in the videos.

447
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:57,744
You'd pretend to be happy too
if you knew what they did to me.

448
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,649
- Testicular torture?
- Yeah.

449
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:01,051
- Ohh.
- Look,

450
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:02,619
we have reason to believe
David Stovelman

451
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:03,787
murdered his wife, Debbie.

452
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:05,089
- Yeah, duh!
- All right, Jay.

453
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:06,523
- Try to remain calm, here.
- Sorry.

454
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:08,025
- I'm just so scarred.
- Right,

455
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:09,427
from the nard torture.

456
00:15:09,463 --> 00:15:11,196
Look, we have evidence
that could tie David

457
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:12,966
to his wife's death,
but we need your help

458
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:14,859
- to get to him.
- Yeah, I'll do whatever you want.

459
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:16,381
You have no idea how terrible they are.

460
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,335
Trust me, I do.
They took ten grand from me.

461
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:20,136
Boo-hoo, they kidnapped my dog.

462
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,572
Okay, well, no need to compare stakes.

463
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:23,407
Although I doubt your dog cost $10,000.

464
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:24,808
You can't put a price on life.

465
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:26,894
You're absolutely right. Thank
you so much for your help, sir.

466
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:29,079
- Sergeant?
- Aah!

467
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:30,214
I need to tell you something.

468
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:31,648
Great. Can't wait to hear it.

469
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:33,350
First, could you pass
that thing over there?

470
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:35,724
Sure, yes. Oh, what thing? I don't...

471
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:38,040
Sergeant?

472
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:40,171
- Sergeant!
- Oh, hey.

473
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,755
Sergeant?

474
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,013
Sergeant?

475
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:53,622
Okay.

476
00:15:54,206 --> 00:15:56,767
Let's finally get these shelves up.

477
00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:00,265
Goes perfect.

478
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,647
Ohh! Oh, no.

479
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:04,469
Oh, there you are.

480
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:07,151
I was trying to tell you
not to use that wall.

481
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:08,737
It has water damage.

482
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:10,760
Noted.

483
00:16:11,523 --> 00:16:14,324
So Stovelman will pick up Jay
and take him to lunch.

484
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:16,160
We trail them, and then
when they get comfortable,

485
00:16:16,195 --> 00:16:17,828
ambush 'em with the intel
about his wife.

486
00:16:17,863 --> 00:16:20,764
Wow. I can't believe we're
working a sting operation

487
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,199
- with a celebrity.
- I know.

488
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:23,634
I feel like we're in "Oceans 11."

489
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:24,701
You're such a Clooney.

490
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:26,403
- Ooh, and I'm Elliot Gould.
- Wow.

491
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:28,628
Just skipped right over
Pitt and Damon, huh?

492
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:30,674
- I've been good!
- Oh, no!

493
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:32,743
- Those are NutriCore guys.
- They're taking Jay!

494
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:34,777
It's not a pick up. It's a throw in.

495
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:36,847
- Where's Jay?
- Hey, Bill.

496
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:38,282
- Boom, boom!
- No boom, boom.

497
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:40,350
- I am not Bill.
- Look, we're with the NYPD.

498
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:43,053
We saw two NutriCore thugs
kidnap Jay and bring him here.

499
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:44,855
- Now where is he?
- Bill, you're a cop!

500
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,890
- No, I am not Bill!
- If you don't cooperate,

501
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:48,725
we'll consider you an accessory
to this crime.

502
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,227
I don't know what you mean by crime.

503
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:51,528
Jay's just voluntarily hanging out with

504
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:53,397
some nutrition
specialists in the basement.

505
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:55,165
You can see for yourself
if you'd like, Bill.

506
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,867
I will see for myself,
but I am not Bill.

507
00:16:56,902 --> 00:16:58,135
- Good one, Bill.
- Oh!

508
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,188
Get out of here.

509
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:02,372
- Jay! Oh, my God.
- Boom, boom, guys!

510
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:04,274
What? We saw them take you.
Are you okay?

511
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:05,843
What are you talking about?

512
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:08,345
- Oh, the van thing?
- Yeah, Jay. The van thing.

513
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,847
Those are just my friends
from NutriBoom.

514
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:11,648
They were worried about
my amino acid levels,

515
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:14,513
so they rushed me straight here
to give me more or less of them.

516
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:15,886
Why are you talking like that?

517
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:16,958
What did they do to you?

518
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:18,255
Oh, I see.

519
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,264
They gave you back your dog.

520
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,924
No, they found my dog.

521
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,093
He was wandering around a park
for a year.

522
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:25,028
Come on, man. Pull it together.

523
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:26,363
These people are evil, remember?

524
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:28,031
David Stovelman murdered his wife.

525
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:29,392
You mean me?

526
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:32,295
- Debbie Stovelman.
- Boom, boom.

527
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:34,871
She is happy, healthy and alive.

528
00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:41,263
Hey, Captain. Just wanted to say

529
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:42,723
sorry about the hole in the wall.

530
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:44,158
I've already called maintenance.

531
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:45,659
- Okay. Anything else?
- God, you're good.

532
00:17:45,694 --> 00:17:46,994
You saw right through me.

533
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:48,233
I failed as a manager.

534
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:51,465
I couldn't deal with this overeager
officer who kept pestering me.

535
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,267
- Ohh, you have an...
- Amy.

536
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:55,436
Yes, I know. We've been
through it a lot today.

537
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:57,037
Well, you should've come to me.

538
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:58,708
I know exactly what it's like to be you.

539
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,940
You used to be an Amy?

540
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:02,203
No, I never had your level
of insecurity.

541
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,048
I was referring to managing an Amy.

542
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,547
Of course. Well, I'm not sure
there's anything left to try.

543
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:07,848
No matter what I did,

544
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:09,517
he just kept interrupting me

545
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:10,918
with all his own ideas.

546
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:12,152
- Were they good ideas?
- I don't know.

547
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:13,551
I didn't listen to them.

548
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:15,530
Damn.

549
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:17,015
Did you just solve it that easily?

550
00:18:17,051 --> 00:18:20,668
Yes, I did. You see, managing Amy
is not a chore, it's a pleasure.

551
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:22,696
- Because an Amy is a tool.
- I'm a tool?

552
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:24,460
Yes, you're a massive tool.

553
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:26,299
You're useful and valuable.

554
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:28,663
Sure, an Amy can be
intimidating sometimes

555
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:30,433
because they have such strong ideas.

556
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:32,569
But you should always listen to an Amy

557
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:34,341
because they will only make you better.

558
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:37,854
At least, that's my experience.

559
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:40,100
Thank you, sir.

560
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,880
<i>Jay, would you please excuse us.</i>

561
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,616
I believe there's a brand new motorcycle

562
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:46,085
with your name on it upstairs.

563
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,654
You guys are the best.

564
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:49,423
Thanks for bringing my dog back.

565
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,124
He looks almost exactly the same.

566
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:52,893
- Come on.
- Boom, boom, Jake.

567
00:18:52,928 --> 00:18:54,962
- Boom, boom, Charles.
- Boom, boom, Jay.

568
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:55,996
What's going on here?

569
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:57,964
- I thought you were murdered.
- I was never dead.

570
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,467
Then what was that 100k
payment to ScepterCore for?

571
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:02,369
It was to get you off the grid.

572
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:04,171
Because the Feds were investigating you.

573
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:06,106
You can't indict someone
who doesn't exist.

574
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:07,407
So you're still working for NutriBoom?

575
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:09,977
Working for? I am NutriBoom.

576
00:19:10,302 --> 00:19:12,980
Look, your annoying little
crusade is wasting my time.

577
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:15,415
I want you to leave me
and my company alone.

578
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,251
Not gonna happen.
Now we know you're alive

579
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:18,518
and I bet the Feds would be interested

580
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:19,720
- in knowing that, too.
- Maybe,

581
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:20,689
but the fact remains,

582
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:22,292
I haven't committed any crimes...

583
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:23,590
that anyone can prove.

584
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,425
So you can try your luck with the Feds.

585
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,927
Or you can get your money back and go on

586
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:28,228
that expensive honeymoon.

587
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:29,529
How do you know about my honeymoon?

588
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:31,486
- I know everything.
- Oh, really?

589
00:19:31,522 --> 00:19:34,273
Because you don't know about
my big ass moral compass.

590
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:36,982
Damn!

591
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,693
I'm going to the Feds,
and you're going down.

592
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:43,610
Also, can you tell us
how to get out of here?

593
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:45,378
This place is a real maze.

594
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:47,381
Oh, Officer Jennings?

595
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,548
Can I speak to you for a minute?

596
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,750
Of course. Nothing I like more

597
00:19:49,785 --> 00:19:51,218
than one-on-one time with my boss.

598
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:52,853
Wow, it's like staring in a mirror.

599
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:54,254
- What?
- Nothing.

600
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:55,923
Listen, I wanna apologize.

601
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,293
I ignored your ideas
and that was a mistake.

602
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:00,894
Please, tell me your suggestions

603
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,362
- for the filing system.
- It's actually

604
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:04,731
five suggestions and 23 sub suggestions.

605
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:06,566
- And I...
- After the briefing.

606
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:08,790
Ohh. Copy that.

607
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:10,837
All right, listen up, squad.

608
00:20:10,872 --> 00:20:12,539
We had increased criminal activity

609
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:13,840
in the park last night, so we'll be

610
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,509
doubling our patrols there today.

611
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:18,648
After the meeting,
I will be handing out new...

612
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:25,785
assignments.

613
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:28,675
Oh, my God, I did it.

614
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,191
The Feds said our intel could help them

615
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:32,592
maybe take down Stovelman someday,

616
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:35,095
- but they didn't sound hopeful.
- Well, I'm glad

617
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,363
- you did the right thing.
- Really?

618
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:37,798
Even though it means
we now have no money

619
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,433
- for a decent honeymoon?
- It's hard not to

620
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:40,867
say a really corny thing right now

621
00:20:40,902 --> 00:20:42,669
about how every day's
a honeymoon with you.

622
00:20:42,704 --> 00:20:45,138
Aww. Although, technically,
you did you just say it.

623
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:46,967
Which is very embarrassing for you.

624
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:50,631
Jake, don't freak out.

625
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,934
There's a really creepy guy
spying on us.

626
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:54,715
Oh, no, no, no.

627
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,416
That's just Phil from NutraBoom.

628
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:57,993
He'll be intimidating us from now on.

629
00:20:58,028 --> 00:21:00,820
There's an evil corporation
hell-bent on destroying us.

630
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:02,682
Hi, Phil! Boom, boom!

631

1
00:00:00,103 --> 00:00:01,403
Santiago, your test results

2
00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:02,996
from the sergeant's exam have arrived.

3
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:04,798
Ooh, everybody make room.

4
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:07,582
Amy needs adequate space
to do her signature dork dance.

5
00:00:07,618 --> 00:00:09,218
I don't know if there's
going to be a dork dance.

6
00:00:09,253 --> 00:00:10,686
I mean, look how small that envelope is.

7
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:12,254
That's not a big, good news envelope.

8
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:13,823
That's a little, bad news envelope.

9
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:16,158
What? That's nuts.
Sarge, tell her envelope size

10
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:17,827
- doesn't matter.
- If I'm being honest,

11
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:19,495
- I got a much bigger envelope.
- Oh, God.

12
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,729
Unhelpful, Terry. Very unhelpful.

13
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:22,298
- Mine was bigger, too.
- Okay.

14
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,466
I just won't ever open it.

15
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:24,800
That way, I'll never get rejected.

16
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:26,435
- Fine, I'll open it.
- No!

17
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,636
Oh, whoa!

18
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:28,671
Do it harder.

19
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:29,859
I opened it.

20
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:32,475
- You passed.
- Oh, my God.

21
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,742
I'm going to be a sergeant.

22
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:34,877
You're going to be a sergeant!

23
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:36,545
Yes!

24
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,781
♪ Oh, no, it's happening. ♪

25
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:40,616
Whoo!

26
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:43,419
- Yeah!
- That's my future wife!

27
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:44,920
So...

28
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:03,866

29
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,099
Amy Santiago, put down that melon,

30
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,179
for you are about to feast your eyes

31
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:13,282
on one of the most delicious
cases in the NYPD.

32
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:14,950
I don't like the personality
I've chosen here.

33
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:16,852
I do. You sound like Caesar Flickerman

34
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:19,288
welcoming new "Hunger Games"
tributes to the Quarter Quell.

35
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:20,623
- What's going on, Jake?
- In one week,

36
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:21,891
you will officially become a sergeant.

37
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:23,325
Which means this case
will be the last one

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,728
we ever work together as detectives,
so it has to be perfect.

39
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:28,898
I present to you a serial arson case.

40
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:30,866
- Mm-hmm.
- And the fires seem to be

41
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,536
connected to the Saturday
crossword puzzle.

42
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:34,737
- Mama like.
- Two different buildings,

43
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:36,238
two consecutive Saturdays,

44
00:01:36,273 --> 00:01:37,982
and a puzzle left at each crime scene,

45
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:40,174
and a note was sent
to the puzzle's author,

46
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,579
- Mr. Melvin Stermley.
- Melvin Stermley?

47
00:01:43,614 --> 00:01:45,581
He's the best in the game!

48
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:47,516
He made a puzzle once
where all the answers

49
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,752
were just the word "puzzle"
in different languages.

50
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:53,756
- In Estonian, it was moistatus.
- Yeah, well, your moistatus

51
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,558
is about to be hecka moist...

52
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:57,293
don't call HR, we are getting married...

53
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:58,694
because Melvin Stermley is coming in

54
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:01,375
- to help us with the case!
- Sha-wing!

55
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:04,533
Hey, I was going through your
calendar for some reason.

56
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:06,902
- It's your job.
- Right.

57
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:09,805
Anyhoobs, I wanted to remind
you about the commissioner

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,341
candidate meet and greet,
and your presentation

59
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:13,742
to the selection committee.

60
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:15,344
Being that I am your campaign manager...

61
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,912
- You are not.
- I did a little sleuthing

62
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:19,348
on your rivals.
You want me to spill the beans?

63
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:21,283
Why would you ever
intentionally spill beans?

64
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:23,652
They're one of nature's most
densely packed protein sources,

65
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:26,355
and they remain unsullied by flavor.

66
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,290
Okay, forget it, I'll just mosey on out.

67
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,292
Fine, fine, tell me everything.

68
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:32,895
All right, have a seat. It's Gina time.

69
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,997
Say hello to your compe-tish.

70
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:38,968
Bryan McCann, John Kelly,
and John Kelly.

71
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,637
Yes, that's right,
there are two John Kellys.

72
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:43,606
How are these not the same man?

73
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:46,508
You should see their wives.
Or should I say, wife.

74
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:48,444
Good God, do you know what
their speeches are about?

75
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,778
I do.

76
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:51,447
"Staying the course."

77
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:52,881
"Maintaining the course," and

78
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,284
"Blazing a path to a new future."

79
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,052
I'm kidding, it's
"Remaining on the course."

80
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:58,587
Unbelievable, none of these men

81
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:00,656
have any interest in advancing the NYPD.

82
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:02,591
That's right, because they're dinosaurs.

83
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:04,426
But do you know what kills dinosaurs?

84
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:05,494
- Asteroids?
- No.

85
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:07,029
You-steroids.

86
00:03:07,064 --> 00:03:09,390
You are going to kill these dinosaurs.

87
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,935
Hey, hey dum-dum. What are you thinking?

88
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,803
Introducing Amy to her celebrity crush?

89
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:16,705
- Are you insane?
- Relax, Charles.

90
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,888
It's not a crush, it's her
nerdy crossword puzzling hero.

91
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,376
I mean, the guy's
got to be a massive dork.

92
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:22,011
His name is Melvin Stermley,
for God's sake.

93
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:24,265
Jake, he's here. Come meet Melvin.

94
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:26,872
Hey, you can call me Vin.

95
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:30,686
But, where is nerd?

96
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:34,857
Whoa, is this a new detective car?

97
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:36,859
It sure is, I put in the paperwork

98
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:40,062
18 months ago, and got lucky.
They fast tracked it!

99
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:44,033
Say hello to the Nine-Nine's
brand new, fully loaded,

100
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:46,502
sweet-as-hell crime-crusher on wheels!

101
00:03:46,537 --> 00:03:50,005
Holy crap, it has a heads-up display
with built-in license plate reader.

102
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,840
Who cares. It's got two burrito holders.

103
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,359
- Those are cup holders, Scully.
- Oh yeah?

104
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:55,332
Then what am I supposed
to use my thighs for, genius?

105
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,796
Wait, who are you assigning
this car to, Sarge?

106
00:03:57,832 --> 00:04:00,462
Um, I was actually thinking
I'd get this one.

107
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:01,750
- Seriously?
- You suck.

108
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:03,686
Whoa, the heater in my detective car

109
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,021
hasn't worked in two years.
I don't have enough body fat

110
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:07,623
to keep warm, Terry's sick of shivering.

111
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:09,124
Okay, just seems a little selfish

112
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,592
to keep it for yourself
when your detectives,

113
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:11,927
who you took an oath to protect,

114
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,729
are stuck driving their crappy old cars.

115
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:16,098
- Mine's the oldest.
- I've never felt so abandoned.

116
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:18,701
And I was actually abandoned.
They found me in a swamp.

117
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,769
Fine. We'll do a drawing for it.

118
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:22,738
But until then, no one touches it.

119
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:24,106
Oops, too late.

120
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:26,008
I left a ranch handprint
on the windshield.

121
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:27,609
Okay, so here are your puzzles

122
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:29,144
from the days the arsonist set the fire.

123
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:31,013
This is really good, Amy, thanks.

124
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:33,982
Hey, so Vin, just curious.
Would you say you have

125
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:35,918
the typical physique
of a puzzle maker, or?

126
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:37,753
Well, each puzzle only pays
a couple hundred bucks,

127
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:39,479
so I mostly make my money modeling.

128
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:41,495
- Primarily swimwear.
- Yeah, I hear that.

129
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,407
I could do that too, but I
make pretty good money here,

130
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:44,400
so I don't really need to.

131
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:45,594
Anyways, let's talk about the case.

132
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:47,863
So here's the letter that
the arsonist sent to Vin.

133
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:50,866
"Your clues I discombobulate
to teach you to conjugate,

134
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:53,969
the fool who fails to validate
will watch as I conflagrate."

135
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:56,071
It seems like he's using my
crossword to tell me something.

136
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:59,541
Oh, maybe we should look
at anagrams of the answers.

137
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:01,577
That's really good, "o nasty amiga!"

138
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:03,412
Oh, what?

139
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:05,514
He re-arranged the letters
of "Amy Santiago."

140
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:08,550
He anagrammed me! Vin, do Jake Peralta.

141
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:10,085
- I doubt that's even possible.
- Eat a jerk, pal.

142
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,054
What, no one's ever said that phrase.

143
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:14,022
I really think this anagram
approach makes a lot of sense.

144
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:15,524
Seriously? Let's do it.

145
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,959
I'll take even clues, you take odds.

146
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:20,095
Great, and I will take
everyone's coffee order.

147
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,864
- That's equally helpful.
- I don't drink coffee.

148
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,920
- But I'd love a kombucha.
- Great, I'll just...

149
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:25,868
walk to the kombucha store.

150
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:28,543
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, of course.

151
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:30,906
You can't wear a coat over a tank,

152
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:33,709
- You're not Ryan Gosling.
- Feeling jealous, buddy?

153
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:35,744
No, not at all.
I mean, I am a little surprised

154
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,980
that somebody named Melvin
is so bodacious,

155
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:40,082
but I feel that jealousy
is an ugly emotion.

156
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:41,683
- That you are feeling.
- And I'm just glad

157
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,118
that Amy is spending
some time with her hero.

158
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:44,720
- Who is super hot.
- Charles, let it go.

159
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:45,954
- And smart.
- I'm serious, stop.

160
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:49,284
And hilarious.

161
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,905
Eat a jerk, pal!

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,872
So, how's it going in here?

163
00:05:53,907 --> 00:05:55,174
Vin, I see you're still coatless.

164
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,981
- I run hot, like a wolf.
- Oh, I see.

165
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:58,555
I wonder if the word "conjugate"

166
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,023
in the arsonist's letter means we should

167
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,085
- focus on the verb answers.
- Cool, I love verbs.

168
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:05,583
- Second favorite part of speech.
- After prepositions.

169
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:07,758
Yeah, words are cool.

170
00:06:07,794 --> 00:06:09,286
But maybe we should switch gears a bit,

171
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:11,189
and get back to some good
old-fashioned police work.

172
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:12,724
- What are you thinking?
- Well, whoever's setting

173
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,392
these fires is clearly trying
to humiliate Vin.

174
00:06:14,427 --> 00:06:15,960
You know, make a puzzle he can't solve.

175
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:17,795
So maybe we should focus
on people that don't like you.

176
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,497
Jake has a point about motive.

177
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:20,899
Maybe another puzzler
wants to take you down.

178
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:22,800
Well, if you're
looking for a puzzle head,

179
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:24,969
I'm hosting a crossword night
at the Turnkey Bar tonight.

180
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:26,771
Oh, I've always wanted to go there.

181
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:28,806
That place is a total puzz-hang.

182
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:31,109
Ah, gross, all right,
so we'll go undercover,

183
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:33,077
chat some people up, and see
if we can't find our arsonist.

184
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:35,046
- Good idea.
- Oh, Amy likes my plan.

185
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:39,517
Great, so Vin, why don't we
just get this coat back on you,

186
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:41,786
and I'll help you
get out of the door, here.

187
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:44,155
And we'll see you tonight, okay, bye!

188
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,524
- The best.
- Right?

189
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:48,092
Yeah!

190
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:50,628
Wow, the competition
looks even older in person.

191
00:06:50,663 --> 00:06:52,664
What do you think these
dinosaurs are talking about?

192
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,198
Where to find "Matlock" reruns?

193
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:55,767
Be professional, Gina.

194
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:57,435
Like the homecare nurses

195
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,970
who will tuck them into bed tonight.

196
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:01,906
- Oh, hello, John.
- Raymond.

197
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:03,141
I just want to say what an honor it is

198
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:04,509
to be up for the same job

199
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:07,412
as a man with your... experience.

200
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:08,674
Thank you.

201
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,450
I paused suggestively
before I said "experience,"

202
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:14,485
so he would know
it wasn't really a compliment.

203
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,854
Who are you talking to?
I invented the pause.

204
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:19,457
Raymond Holt,
I'm Captain Olivia Crawford.

205
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:21,366
I'm the new candidate for commissioner.

206
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:22,420
- Oh?
- Excuse me?

207
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:23,694
Yeah, I replaced the other candidate.

208
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,730
He retired to spend more time
with his grandchildren.

209
00:07:25,765 --> 00:07:27,899
Anyway, I just wanted to say
what a privilege it is

210
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:32,670
to be up for the same job
as a man with your... tenure.

211
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:35,673
- Oh, damn, she paused, dude.
- In error, I am certain.

212
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,908
Olivia, I may be older than you,

213
00:07:36,943 --> 00:07:38,476
but I am not some dinosaur

214
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:40,011
intent on maintaining the status quo.

215
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:43,047
For example, I would add
a social media officer

216
00:07:43,082 --> 00:07:44,860
- to every precinct.
- Interesting.

217
00:07:45,438 --> 00:07:47,719
I plan on eliminating
precincts all together.

218
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:49,887
What, no precincts?
That's not how we do things.

219
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:52,387
That's exactly what
both John Kellys said.

220
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:56,527
Oh no, she's the asteroid.

221
00:07:56,562 --> 00:07:58,985
And I don't want to say
you're a dinosaur, but...

222
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:00,981
You're a dinosaur.

223
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:03,901
Wow, a whole crowd full of puzzlers.

224
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:05,770
Gotta be honest,
I'm a little disappointed

225
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:07,639
no one's wearing a green suit
covered in question marks.

226
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:09,240
That guy has crossword puzzle pants.

227
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:12,543
- Does that scratch your itch?
- Very much so, thanks.

228
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:14,825
All right, we should probably
start talking to people in line.

229
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:17,015
Pardon me there, fellow puzzler.

230
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,816
What do you think of Melvin Stermley?

231
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:20,685
Uh, you mean my future husband?

232
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,120
Oh, so you like his puzzles?

233
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:24,555
And his face, body, and brain...
and body.

234
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,690
Honestly, Vin makes all other men

235
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:27,525
seem really stupid and ugly.

236
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,760
Okay, well, thank you for your

237
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:30,351
very candid and hurtful input.

238
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:33,064
You must solve
one of Vin's puzzles to enter.

239
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:34,999
Rearrange the letters of this phrase

240
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:36,901
to reveal a place in the world.

241
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:39,603
"Meet a brainier stud, a."

242
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,939
Oh, come on, there's no place
with that many letters in it.

243
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:43,808
I mean, most places
are, like, four letters.

244
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:47,145
- You know, park, mall, dump...
- United Arab Emirates!

245
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,180
You may enter.

246
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:51,315
Uh, you must each answer a puzzle.

247
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,184
Oh... great.

248
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:55,186
Unscramble the letters in this phrase

249
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:58,089
to reveal the name of a film
based on a classic novel.

250
00:08:58,124 --> 00:09:00,958
- Okay.
- "Sad anus loser, I go in"

251
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:03,628
You know, I feel like these puzzles
are actually very pointed.

252
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:05,196
Forget it, I got this.

253
00:09:05,231 --> 00:09:07,198
Uh, A, R, uh...

254
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:10,234
Puzzle solved.

255
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:18,150
Who's the anus loser now?

256
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:21,307
It's still me.

257
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:24,248
Okay, one of us is about to get access

258
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:27,618
to the best detective car ever,
and everyone else

259
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:29,587
will go back to driving junk cars

260
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:31,022
for the rest of your junk lives.

261
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:32,857
Damn, Sarge, that took a dark turn.

262
00:09:32,892 --> 00:09:35,031
I want seat warmers. I want them bad.

263
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,194
I need this car too.

264
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:38,229
I'm sick of riding my
Vespa to work every day.

265
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:40,098
Well, being on the seat
behind you is no picnic either.

266
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,466
All right, here it goes.

267
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:46,804
What?

268
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,041
Oh, my God, it says "Terry." I won!

269
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:52,710
♪ Terry got a car, Terry got a car ♪

270
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:54,045
No way. You cheated.

271
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,047
What? I didn't cheat.

272
00:09:56,082 --> 00:09:57,694
I bet every slip in there says Terry.

273
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,853
He filled it full of fake people.

274
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:04,122
- Who the hell is Norm?
- That's Scully's first name.

275
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:05,923
- It is?
- Stop being sore losers.

276
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,258
I won fair and square.

277
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:08,926
No, you won unfair and un-square,

278
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:10,995
- and I'm going to prove it.
- And if we can't,

279
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,464
- we'll plant it.
- No.

280
00:10:12,832 --> 00:10:14,182
Charles, I need your help.

281
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:15,767
What's the best way
to dry out a pant leg that's

282
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:17,702
- been soaked in toilet water?
<i>- Wait 28 minutes.</i>

283
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:19,637
Trust me, that's how long it
takes for toilet pants to dry.

284
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:21,172
Well, I can't just be standing around

285
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:23,107
for half an hour while
Amy chats it up with Vin.

286
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:26,377
Ah, so it's not toilet water.
You're drenched in jealousy.

287
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:29,412
I told you before, jealousy is an
ugly emotion that I don't feel.

288
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:31,202
Besides, Amy picked
my plan to come here.

289
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:32,369
Why would I be jealous of Vin?

290
00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:35,286
Because of his body, and
face, and brain... and body.

291
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:36,921
Why does everybody say "body" twice?

292
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:38,389
Oh, hang on a second.

293
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:40,091
- Somebody's coming.
- Vin is on fire tonight.

294
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:42,026
- He's phenomenal.
- No wonder the Saturday

295
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:43,995
crossword replaced Sam with him.

296
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,264
- Sam must be pissed.
- I heard the only place

297
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:48,366
that buys his puzzles now
is "Parade" magazine.

298
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,668
The hardest clue he had in his last one

299
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:52,770
was a five-letter word for a game

300
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:55,273
- popular in nursing homes.
- Bingo.

301
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,841
I figured out who the arsonist is.

302
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:58,876
It's this guy named Sam.
He's a puzzle maker.

303
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:01,377
- And Vin took his job.
- Sam Jepson?

304
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:02,470
Oh, he's not the arsonist.

305
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:03,664
He's been out of town for weeks.

306
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:04,833
And he's one of my closest friends.

307
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,267
He let me stay on his couch

308
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:07,701
when Anna Kournikova and I broke up.

309
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:09,837
Well, I mean, she never won a major, so.

310
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:11,839
All right, fine, if I'm so
wrong, what did you guys find?

311
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:13,440
Both fires were located

312
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:14,810
at the intersection of numbered streets.

313
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:16,379
If you match those
intersections with the same

314
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,482
intersections of the
numbered clues in the puzzles,

315
00:11:18,518 --> 00:11:20,056
you get the letters "MA".

316
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,814
We think the arsonist
is spelling his name.

317
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,651
We can build a puzzle around that,
and catch him setting his next fire.

318
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:27,133
But we have a suspect
with a crystal clear motive.

319
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,537
I think we need to solve this
like cops, not puzzlers.

320
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,373
I hear you, Jake.
But people who make crosswords

321
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:32,976
love hiding their names
in their puzzles.

322
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:34,378
It's our version of a self portrait.

323
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:35,947
All right, you know what?

324
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:38,017
Amy, it's your last case, you decide.

325
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:39,832
Should we go with
Vin's wacky little plan,

326
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,874
or should we go with Sam Jepson,

327
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,809
my exceptionally solid lead?

328
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:47,138
I see where you're coming from,
Jake, but this is Vin's world,

329
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,174
and I think we should
go with his strategy.

330
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,822
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

331
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:53,688
- Yeah, sounds great.
- Okay, great.

332
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:55,754
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

333
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:59,186
Oh, no, ugly emotion.

334
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:02,858
Okay, so we think the
arsonist is using the fires

335
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:04,039
to spell out his name.

336
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:05,142
The most common third letter

337
00:12:05,178 --> 00:12:07,671
in names that start with "MA"
are L for Malcolm,

338
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:09,674
X for Max, R for Mark,
and T for Matthew.

339
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,910
Or his name is Sam,
and he's spelling it backwards.

340
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:13,083
Uh-huh.

341
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:15,780
Let's just stick with the LXRT plan.

342
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,616
- Copy that.
- Vin designed today's puzzle

343
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:19,417
using only one of each of those letters.

344
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,637
Isn't that the craziest
thing you've ever seen?

345
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:22,772
I don't know, I mean, remember that time

346
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,422
we investigated the
disappearance of Mrs. Jackson,

347
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:26,391
and it turned out her
parrot ate her, bones and all?

348
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:28,293
- That was pretty crazy.
- That was crazy.

349
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:29,861
Yeah.

350
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,663
So tonight, we'll stake
out the intersections

351
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:33,899
that correspond to where
the L, X, R, and T are

352
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:36,568
in Vin's puzzle, and hopefully
catch the arsonist in the act.

353
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:39,771
I'll take the MAT corner,
you take the MAR corner,

354
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:42,440
and we'll have patrolman
take the MAL and MAX.

355
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:44,024
- Cool?
- Yep, very cool.

356
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,694
Okay, great, I'll get
the surveillance equipment.

357
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,432
Shame.

358
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:50,448
Shame, shame, shame.

359
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,521
I can't believe you're doing Vin's plan.

360
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:54,157
Will you relax? I'm only doing it

361
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:55,601
because someone else
is going to do my plan.

362
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:56,803
- Who?
- You.

363
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,080
- Oh.
- While I'm busy watching

364
00:12:58,116 --> 00:12:59,276
nothing happen on my stupid corner,

365
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,345
you're going to stake
out Sam's apartment.

366
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,526
Then when he sets a fire,
Vin is going to look like a dummy.

367
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,647
That's right, use the jealousy, Jake.

368
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,627
It will give you unimaginable power.

369
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:09,751
Yes, yes, I can feel it
coursing through my veins.

370
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:10,853
- Oh, my hand cramped.
- Oh.

371
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,060
Oh, it's stuck in a claw.

372
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:13,655
- It's a claw now.
- Oh.

373
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:16,358
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

374
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:18,293
You're snacking? This is from the guy

375
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:20,095
who told me that eating finger foods

376
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,596
was the one true sign of depression?

377
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:23,298
Then watch me chew, Gina.

378
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,500
I'm a creature of the past.
I'm a dinosaur.

379
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:28,236
No, you are not, you're
the best man for the job.

380
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:30,105
And I think you know what
you have to do to get it.

381
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,895
Believe in myself
and give a great presentation?

382
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,044
Not even close.

383
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,479
That's the head of the committee
over there, gorging on crab cakes.

384
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:39,348
Just go up to him and sabotage Olivia.

385
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:40,568
Um...

386
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,551
- I don't think I can do that.
- Well, you can't really be

387
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:44,686
the best commissioner
the NYPD has ever had

388
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:46,690
if you're not the commissioner.

389
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:51,174
Right. You're right, I want this.

390
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,396
And I will do good things for the city.

391
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:56,698
Yes, you will. Now, get over there,

392
00:13:56,733 --> 00:14:00,093
and crap all over Olivia's ideas.

393
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:03,539
- Patrick, nice to see you.
- Hello, Raymond.

394
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:06,241
- Shall we small-talk?
- Mm.

395
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:08,210
I've been thinking recently
about how vital

396
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:10,712
the existence of precincts
is to the NYPD.

397
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,865
Oh, you spoke to Crawford.

398
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,283
She's very forward thinking, isn't she?

399
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:17,219
I suppose you could call it that.

400
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:18,754
I mean, I wouldn't, but...

401
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:21,375
Ray, you don't need to worry about her.

402
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:26,495
Between you and me, we had to
nominate a girl for PR reasons.

403
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:28,363
There's no way the NYPD

404
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:30,859
is ready for a female commissioner.

405
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,402
- Oh.
- Hey.

406
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,203
Grab a crab cake before we start.

407
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:37,194
Real crab, big chunks.

408
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:42,644
Okay, no one saw Sarge
do anything suspicious

409
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,479
on the day of the drawing.
We got nothing.

410
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:47,021
Speak for yourself, sister.
We found a smoking gun.

411
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:48,056
Play it, Hitchcock.

412
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:49,250
- Voila.
- Bah-boom.

413
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:51,253
- What, I don't see anything.
- Focus on the butt.

414
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:53,998
- The butt don't lie.
- He squeezed his cheeks

415
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:56,291
before he opened the slip.
He knew his name was on it.

416
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:58,059
It was a pre-emptive celebration clench.

417
00:14:58,094 --> 00:15:00,328
I don't know, we need better
proof than a butt clench

418
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:02,564
- to take down Terry.
- I did it, okay?

419
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:05,767
I cheated. I wanted that car,
and I took it.

420
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:08,437
And it's killing me.
I couldn't sleep all night.

421
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:10,439
I just kept hearing the blinker.

422
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:13,408
You-cheat, you-cheat, you-cheat.

423
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:15,710
Here are the keys. Take the damn car.

424
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,186
Terry doesn't deserve it.

425
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,582
And that is why I became a cop.

426
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:24,820
Hey, Charles, nothing's
happening on my MAR corner.

427
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,556
- Any movement at Sam's place?
- No, I did, however, see

428
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:30,091
a cool-looking dude in a ponytail
on a Razor scooter.

429
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:31,760
I have to admit, I like the look.

430
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:34,229
Is it possible I'm wrong,
and Sam is out of town?

431
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:35,897
Vin's plan is actually kind of smart.

432
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:38,733
- Jake, I have eyes on Sam.
<i>- Yes, suck it, Vin.</i>

433
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:40,368
My judgment is clear, and I am a genius.

434
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:41,603
Charles, I'll be right there.

435
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:43,438
But enough about the crab cakes.

436
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:46,408
Our first presentation tonight

437
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,443
will be from the 99th precinct's

438
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:50,312
Captain Raymond Holt. Raymond?

439
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,118
Let me begin with a hilarious joke.

440
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:58,352
I'm surprised I was on the
short list for commissioner.

441
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:00,557
After all, I am six feet tall.

442
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:04,871
Actually, what I have to say
tonight is no laughing matter.

443
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:06,862
I was just told by a member
of the selection committee

444
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,597
that they have no intention

445
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,267
of ever choosing
a woman to run the NYPD.

446
00:16:11,493 --> 00:16:12,757
I suppose I should have been relieved,

447
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:15,303
because Captain Crawford
is a damn qualified candidate.

448
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:17,205
But as someone who has
been denied opportunity

449
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,556
because of who I am,

450
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:21,776
I cannot stand by and watch
it happen to someone else.

451
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:24,679
So, I will be reserving my presentation

452
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:27,148
for a selection committee
that will judge

453
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:28,850
all of the candidates fairly.

454
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:30,459
And let's be honest.

455
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:32,575
The crab cakes were only so-so.

456
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,159
Thank you.

457
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,392
All right, talk to me, what's happening?

458
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:39,928
- What's Sammy up to?
- Well, he just sat down

459
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:42,097
- on the plaza.
- Okay, he's opening up

460
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:45,400
his backpack and pulling out
what appears to be a thermos.

461
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:47,936
Possibly containing some sort
of accelerant-like gasoline.

462
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:49,704
- Yup.
- No, he's eating it

463
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:51,606
with a spoon.
It's soup, he's eating soup.

464
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:54,479
Well, maybe he's fueling up
for a night of starting fires.

465
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,910
He just pulled out a lighter!

466
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:58,587
Nope, it's not a lighter.
It's a bumblebee PEZ dispenser.

467
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,318
- Hmm.
- Ooh, he's making a phone call.

468
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,516
Quick, get the parabolic mic.

469
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:04,419
<i>Mom, I did something bad.</i>

470
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:06,288
Yeah, you set some fires.

471
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:08,757
<i>I proposed to Gretchen, and she said no.</i>

472
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:12,141
- So you set some fires.
<i>- So, I left Myrtle Beach.</i>

473
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:13,911
Two weeks ago,
and then you set some fires.

474
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:15,474
<i>No, I got back home today.</i>

475
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:18,073
<i>Yeah, all my fish were dead.</i>

476
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,405
Okay, so Sam didn't do it.

477
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:20,996
I should probably get back to my corner.

478
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:22,061
Just for the record,

479
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:23,371
just because I was wrong about Sam,

480
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:25,607
does not mean that Vin was right.

481
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:30,222
Well, this is disappointing.

482
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:33,463
I can't believe you left your post.

483
00:17:33,498 --> 00:17:34,975
What, the plan wasn't yours,

484
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:36,444
so you didn't think
it was worth following?

485
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Well, because of your juvenile behavior,

486
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,383
one of our city's finest...

487
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:43,020
abandoned lard factories
is now burned to the ground.

488
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:45,190
My gut told me that Sam
Jepson was setting the fires.

489
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:46,626
Although I now realize his actual life

490
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:48,462
is much sadder than that
of a serial arsonist.

491
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:50,231
But we agreed to do Vin's plan.

492
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:52,050
So what? Vin is not a cop.

493
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:53,802
Why do you keep siding
with him instead of me?

494
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:55,284
Oh, let me guess, because he was right,

495
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,620
and the building was on fire,
and he's perfect?

496
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:58,855
Wait, are you jealous of Vin?

497
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,007
Jake?

498
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:03,360
All right, I didn't want to say anything

499
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:05,596
because it's a gross emotion,
but yes, I am a little bit

500
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:07,606
jealous of the super smart supermodel.

501
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:09,633
This was our last case together.

502
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:11,485
And you and him have
been joined at the hip.

503
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:13,770
Or in his case, that super sexy V muscle

504
00:18:13,805 --> 00:18:15,372
that I don't understand how to tone.

505
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,241
He told me, it's a lot
of bicycle crunches.

506
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:18,775
Crunches on a bicycle?

507
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,403
That's crazy,
you would just fall right off.

508
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:23,541
Babe, you have no reason
to be jealous of him.

509
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:24,964
I just...

510
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,280
I don't want you to wake up one day

511
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:30,385
and with that you were with
someone as smart as you are.

512
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:32,489
I am with someone as smart as I am.

513
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:33,624
You.

514
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,256
You're a brilliant detective.

515
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,126
I love the way you think.

516
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:39,195
That's why I want to marry you.

517
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,890
Marry me.

518
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,269
Marry. Oh, my God, look.

519
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:47,537
The arsonist spelled MAR,
but they were going to spell

520
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:49,597
M-A-R-R-Y! Or...

521
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:51,441
Conjugate. Conjugate means marry!

522
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,078
Yes, and who wants to marry Vin?

523
00:18:53,114 --> 00:18:54,783
The lady from the bar!

524
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,387
Hey, puzzle chick, unscramble this.

525
00:18:57,423 --> 00:18:59,494
You're going to "ailj."

526
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:02,878
All right, Sarge. The car is yours.

527
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,680
What? Why?

528
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:06,848
- I don't deserve that car.
- I don't know about that.

529
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:09,217
I went back and watched the tapes
to figure out how you did it.

530
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:10,786
Right before the drawing,

531
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:12,454
you got a peanut butter cup
out of the freezer.

532
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:14,389
The thing is, you don't
eat sugar past 4:00 p.m.

533
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:15,724
Could have been a cheat day.

534
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,212
Oh, it was definitely a cheat day.

535
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:18,593
You froze your slip of paper,

536
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:19,995
so that when you pulled the name,

537
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,797
all you had to do was find the cold one.

538
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:22,932
So.

539
00:19:23,192 --> 00:19:24,608
You thought the way I cheated

540
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:26,335
was so cool, you gave me the car?

541
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,903
Yeah, but also while
I was watching those tapes,

542
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:29,538
I noticed all the nice crap
you do for people.

543
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:30,906
You got Gina a cushion for her chair.

544
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:32,808
You let Charles show you 130 pictures

545
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:34,409
of Nikolaj brushing his teeth.

546
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:35,977
You Heimlich'd Scully twice.

547
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:38,415
- On the same peanut.
- I also solved a murder.

548
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:40,278
Yeah, we all solve murders, but you,

549
00:19:40,984 --> 00:19:42,918
you let Hitchcock borrow
a pair of your socks,

550
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:44,463
because his somehow disintegrated.

551
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:46,299
Anyway, I'm sorry I guilted you
in the first place.

552
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:48,635
- You deserve that car.
- Thanks, Diaz.

553
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:51,626
How did you get Hitchcock
and Scully to agree to this?

554
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:53,562
I washed their car and
told them it was a new one.

555
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:54,963
They're napping in it right now.

556
00:19:54,998 --> 00:19:56,302
Smart!

557
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,268
- Hello, Captain Holt.
- Ah, Captain Crawford.

558
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:01,636
To what do I owe the pleasure?

559
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:03,438
Captain Crawford is here to see you.

560
00:20:03,473 --> 00:20:04,631
Thank you, Gina.

561
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,627
So, it would seem that
we have become frenemies.

562
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:11,546
- Do you know what that means?
- Are you trying to imply

563
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:13,348
that I'm too old to
understand a portmanteau?

564
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:16,952
I am not, but I am
too dignified to use one.

565
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:18,180
Friend-enemy.

566
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,502
I just wanted to thank you,
for your brave speech.

567
00:20:20,538 --> 00:20:21,810
The mayor's office has replaced

568
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,518
the selection committee
with a less biased one, so.

569
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:26,828
Feel free to start calling
me commissioner now.

570
00:20:26,863 --> 00:20:28,397
The only time I plan on calling you

571
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:29,664
is to hear you concede.

572
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:30,966
It's going to be hard to hear anything

573
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,734
once I've crushed you
into a fine powder.

574
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:35,230
A fine powder that will
choke you until you die.

575
00:20:35,677 --> 00:20:37,619
May the better candidate win.

576
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,470
She will.

577
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:43,674
Captain Crawford left.

578
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:46,415
So, we brought her in this morning,

579
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,883
and she confessed immediately.

580
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:50,786
Hi, Vin, I love you!
Did you see my fires?

581
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:52,387
Turned out, she was writing something.

582
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:55,657
Specifically, "marry me,
or else I will kill you.

583
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:57,325
Yours forever, Helen Gorbelson."

584
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,061
- Wow, that's so many fires.
- So many fires.

585
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:02,597
Thank you for catching her.
With a brilliant puzzling mind

586
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:04,499
like yours on the case,
it was only a matter of time.

587
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:05,901
Actually, Jake solved it.

588
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:07,738
He's kind of a genius with this stuff.

589
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:08,936
Oh, thank you, then.

590
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:09,983
Couldn't have done it without your help.

591
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,266
So I guess that's that.

592
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:12,507
I should probably run
if I'm going to make it

593
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,239
to the Javits Center by four.

594
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,306
They're making a mold of me for
the upcoming Bodies Exhibit.

595
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,743
As they should, your body is great.

596
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,445
- And that's okay.
- Thanks, man.

597
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,050
You should join me
for a puzzle night sometime.

598
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:23,339
- Oh.
- No!

599
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,487
Jake is taken. He already has a friend.

600
00:21:25,522 --> 00:21:27,055
Hang out offer declined.

601
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,890
Now let's strut your
centerfold ass out of here.

602

1
00:00:01,252 --> 00:00:02,852
Gobble! Gobble!

2
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:05,388
Tommy Gobbler's back
and he wants to hear

3
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:07,757
what you turkeys are thankful for.

4
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:09,474
- Charles, you gotta stop.
- Nah.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,084
I don't gobble understand people.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,152
- But, Charles...
- Gobble.

7
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:13,247
- Dude.
- Gobble.

8
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:15,667
Gobble, gobble, your tail feather
is caught in the gobble door.

9
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:17,408
Thank you. Gobble... wait, what?

10
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:20,803
Ow.

11
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,739
I think your feathers are ripping.

12
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:24,607
Gobble.

13
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:26,409
Gobble.

15
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:48,140
All right, you know the drill.

16
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:50,299
We've been living and breathing
this operation for years.

17
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:52,735
It goes down today
and we only get one shot.

18
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:56,048
Thanksgiving 2017,
the meeting of the parents.

19
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:58,318
Our objective is clear.
Our parents will laugh,

20
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:01,122
they will bond, and then
when the time is right,

21
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:02,912
our fathers will share a hug good-bye

22
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:05,322
and it will be weird,
but in the good way.

23
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:07,216
Oh, my God. What is that photo?

24
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:08,851
I did an image search for dad's hugging.

25
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:10,486
I didn't have a lot of time
to put this board together.

26
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:12,887
Now then, let's review
our targets, shall we?

27
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:14,891
First we have the Santiagos:
Camila and Victor.

28
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:16,392
They are traditional, reserved,

29
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:17,860
and like their daughter, controlling.

30
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:19,429
I wouldn't say I'm controlling.

31
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:20,753
I would say I'm Type A.

32
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,523
You should write Type A there
instead of controlling.

33
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:24,033
Vivid example of what we're up against.

34
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,968
Now then, on the other side,
we have the Peraltas:

35
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:29,148
Karen and Roger. They are
perfectly normal, no known flaws.

36
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,708
All right, fine.
My dad's a selfish drunken slut

37
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:34,059
- and my mom's a flighty weirdo.
- This is gonna be a disaster.

38
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,447
I knew you'd say that,
which is why we have this.

39
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:38,948
A list of things they have in common.

40
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:40,583
We can use it to grease
the conversation.

41
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:42,985
Ooh, convo grease.

42
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,630
This is perfect.

43
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:47,356
Okay, our dads both golf.
Our mom's both paint.

44
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:49,292
All four of them have hair.

45
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:50,526
Yeah, but that's
bottom of the barrel stuff.

46
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:51,961
We're not gonna have to use that.

47
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:53,730
Oh, you did a lot of work on this.

48
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,732
- I'm really impressed.
- Oh, well, you know,

49
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,000
it's really important to me.
I feel like it's a chance

50
00:01:58,036 --> 00:01:59,969
for me to finally have
the big family Thanksgiving

51
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:02,205
- I never got as a kid.
- Oh, babe.

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,539
It's gonna be amazing.

53
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:08,878
Are you erasing the word
controlling behind my back

54
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:11,347
- while we kiss?
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,649
We can keep it in my office
until it's time to leave.

56
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:15,418
What do you have in the
pastry box, sir? Brownies?

57
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:16,910
No, you hold brownies from the side.

58
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:18,145
He's holding it from the bottom.

59
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,689
True. Maybe it s a cheesecake.

60
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:21,557
But there's no condensation on the box.

61
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:23,326
- It's room temperature.
- Look at the finger spread,

62
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:24,660
tensing in the shoulders.

63
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:26,863
He's supporting something dense.

64
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,499
- It's a pie.
- It is a pie.

65
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:32,635
- Damn, that was impressive.
- But this is not just any pie.

66
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,637
It's an English walnut pie
from the Cottage Inn

67
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:36,572
- in Saratoga Springs.
- Raymond and I drive

68
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:38,274
all the way upstate for it every year.

69
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:39,575
It's the finest sweet treat on earth.

70
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:41,277
Even better than a plain scone.

71
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:42,529
Wow, that good, huh?

72
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:44,465
We're bringing it to Kevin's
parents' house tonight.

73
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:47,583
Can't wait. What do you all
have planned for Turkey day?

74
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:50,186
Well, I've got a great
Thanksgiving planned.

75
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:52,354
Nikolaj has taken to food
just like his papa,

76
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,690
so I'm making an exotic spread.

77
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:57,360
If it can fly or swim,
we're eating its eggs.

78
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:59,629
Well, at the Jefford's house,
it's not just Thanksgiving,

79
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:02,565
it's also Ava's birthday,
so we do it up huge.

80
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,267
I got her a Perry the Parrot.

81
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,469
That's a hot toy.
Terry tried ten toy stores.

82
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:09,305
I guess I'm only one
doing this holiday right.

83
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,940
Hitting the open road with my bike.

84
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:13,643
No family, no friends, no dinner.

85
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:15,912
- That sounds really dark.
- Thank you.

86
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:17,947
Well, everyone's plans seem lovely.

87
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:19,582
Oh, Hitchcock and I didn't say ours.

88
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,795
How unfortunate.

89
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:23,619
Okay, the house is all clean.

90
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:24,921
The wine is in the fridge.

91
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,522
What is this pitcher of gray water?

92
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:29,625
I read an article that said
when you wash vegetables,

93
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,694
all the nutrients leech into the water

94
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:34,864
and then you can drink it.
They call it a super water.

95
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:36,699
Oh. Well, that's neat.

96
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:38,901
I am gonna just hide it right over here.

97
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,336
Dad, you almost ready?

98
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:41,950
The Santiago's are very punctual?

99
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:43,919
I'm already out of the shower.

100
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:45,508
- Chill, bro.
- Don't call me bro.

101
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,276
- I'm your son.
- Okay, dude.

102
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:48,911
Dude is not an improvement.

103
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:50,780
- Oh, boy, they're here.
- Oh, now, honey,

104
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:53,416
I know you're nervous,
but it's gonna be fine.

105
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:54,917
We can handle ourselves.

106
00:03:54,953 --> 00:03:57,887
Hola. Feliz Thanksgiving.

107
00:03:57,922 --> 00:03:59,789
Jake told me you were Cuban.

108
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,591
Yes, I did, and I regret it. Come on in.

109
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:03,926
So nice to finally meet you. I'm Victor.

110
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:05,962
- And I'm Camila.
- Oh.

111
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,930
- And you brought a turkey?
- Sure did.

112
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,699
Even though I told her that
you were making the turkey,

113
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,567
and all she needed to
bring was stuffing.

114
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:14,437
The stuffing's inside it and
now we have two turkeys,

115
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:16,906
- just in case.
- In case of what?

116
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:18,774
I don't know.

117
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,776
Anyway, it was in the car
when she picked me up.

118
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:22,778
- Isn't that fun?
- The most fun.

119
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:24,347
Why don't we just get comfortable.

120
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:26,382
- My dad is just...
- Hey, Kare-bear,

121
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,817
- which pants do you think...
- Dad!

122
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:30,686
- Honey.
- The Santiagos are here.

123
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:33,812
Feliz Thanksgiving. How was the trip in?

124
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:35,157
The flight must have been awful.

125
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:36,692
- Hey, Dad?
- This holiday is the worst.

126
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:38,394
Could we just press pause on
that and maybe get some pants?

127
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,229
Fine. I'll put on some pants.

128
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:41,487
Thanks.

129
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:44,299
Squad, bullpen, now.

130
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:46,302
- Is everything okay, sir?
- No, it is not.

131
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:48,272
I went to a meeting and when I returned,

132
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:50,573
my pie was gone.
Which one of you took it?

133
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:52,808
Calm down, there's no
need to point fingers.

134
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,225
At us. It was clearly
Hitchcock and Scully.

135
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,203
How dare you. You have no proof.

136
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,719
There's crumbs all over your desks.

137
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:00,449
Well, these aren't pie crumbs.

138
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:03,185
Bread, cookie, pizza, sandwich, blintz,

139
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:05,655
and one good old fashioned potato chip.

140
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:08,911
No pie here. I just humiliated you.

141
00:05:08,947 --> 00:05:10,647
Look, this doesn't have
to be a big deal.

142
00:05:10,683 --> 00:05:12,295
Whoever took that pie, come forward

143
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,992
and all will be forgiven.

144
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,566
Smart. You knew
I would never forgive you.

145
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:20,536
But you're dumb if you think
I won't get to the bottom of this.

146
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,339
Everyone here is a suspect.

147
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:24,740
Okay, not off to a great start.

148
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:26,509
My mom brought
a passive-aggressive turkey

149
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:28,210
and we all saw your dad's penis
through his undies.

150
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:29,902
What? You did? Why were you looking?

151
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:31,954
No, I wasn't. It all happened so fast.

152
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,517
Hey, everyone, I'm sorry
for not being "dressed."

153
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:36,719
I didn't think you guys
were gonna be so early.

154
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,517
We arrived at the agreed upon time.

155
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:40,881
Right. So, like, super early.

156
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,458
Convo grease.
Convo grease them right now.

157
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:43,993
Yes. Mrs. Peralta,

158
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:47,330
I love this new ceramic
that you painted.

159
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:48,731
You know, my mom paints as well.

160
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,333
- Really?
- Yes.

161
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:52,468
- I paint on canvases though.
- Oh.

162
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:54,337
- And that's different?
- Very.

163
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:56,238
- Completely.
- I just always found canvas

164
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:57,640
to be too restricting.

165
00:05:57,675 --> 00:06:01,377
For me with bowls
and vases and furniture,

166
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:02,812
the world is my canvas.

167
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:05,448
Yes, and for me, with canvas,

168
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:07,416
the canvas is my canvas.

169
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,919
- She said "canvas" so much.
- Who wants to hear a joke?

170
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,854
Do you mean like a riddle?
'Cause I love riddles.

171
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,155
No, I mean like a joke joke,
where I say it and you laugh.

172
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,290
No, then I'm not interested.

173
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:18,694
Oh. Well... golf.

174
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,630
Yes, golf. Anyone hit the links lately?

175
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,555
- I don't play golf.
- What are you talking about?

176
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,967
You played it all the time
when I was a kid.

177
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:27,536
- Never played golf in my life.
- Jake, you're remembering

178
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:29,305
when he used to pretend to golf

179
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,374
so that he could spend his
Sunday's cheating on me.

180
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:33,509
- Ah.
- Oh, yeah.

181
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:35,311
- Oops.
- But it's okay now.

182
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:36,979
We're happy, we're back together...

183
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,514
- We're cool.
- And, you know,

184
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:40,383
all relationships have rough patches.

185
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,300
- Right, Camila?
- No.

186
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,808
- Jake.
- Hair.

187
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:49,425
We all have hair.

188
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,493
Mm.

189
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:52,753
Okay, this is bad.

190
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,038
None of the convo grease worked.

191
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:55,973
We need a new plan.
There's gotta be some way

192
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:57,641
- to make them get along.
- Maybe we could play a game.

193
00:06:57,677 --> 00:07:00,399
No. No games.
My dad gets super competitive.

194
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:03,214
He used to flip out on me
when I beat him at Adult Clue.

195
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,118
It was the only board game
he had at his condo.

196
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:06,633
All the murder weapons were sex toys.

197
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:08,099
Oh, okay. You know what?

198
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:10,213
Actually, my dad is super
competitive too.

199
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:13,067
It's bad. He got kicked off
a bird watching tour once.

200
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:15,217
- Look a kingfisher.
- No, no, no, no, no.

201
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:17,249
That's the same bird I saw earlier.

202
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:18,525
That doesn't count.

203
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:22,432
Yikes. All right, so it's agreed.
We steer clear of all competition.

204
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:23,953
Why can't there be some magic potion

205
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:26,439
that makes everyone happy
and have fun all the time??

206
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:30,336
Who wants some alcohol?

207
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,575
Thank you very much, David.

208
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:33,668
That'll be all.

209
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:38,208
There are no prints on the box,
no DNA evidence,

210
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:40,433
and the security camera
in my office was obscured,

211
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,135
which means whoever took my pie

212
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,736
thought it through. And that means...

213
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:45,004
It wasn't Hitchcock and Scully.

214
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,038
Exactly.

215
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:48,074
Now, as for you three,

216
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:50,076
I think it's time we had a little chat.

217
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,677
How long you been planning this?

218
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:54,013
A day? A week? A year?

219
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:56,449
Or is this the only reason you
joined the force to begin with?

220
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:59,585
So you think I became a cop
just so I can steal your pie?

221
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:01,988
Your words not mine.

222
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,256
No, don't tell me why you did it.

223
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,525
- Tell him.
- You want me to talk to

224
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,460
this picture of your husband?

225
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:09,562
Look him in the eye
and tell him what you did.

226
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:12,398
- I didn't do it, Kevin.
- Don't you say his name.

227
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:13,966
No, Terry, I'm not mad at you.

228
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,168
I know you didn't mean to do it.

229
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,003
You just got hungry,

230
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,471
and that's the most
natural thing in the world.

231
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:21,240
- I didn't take your pie.
- You're lying!

232
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:23,176
If you're so innocent, where were you

233
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,144
- when the pie went missing?
- I was at the grocery store

234
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,979
buying goose feet for Nikolaj's dinner.

235
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:28,948
I was getting the oil
changed in my bike.

236
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:30,550
Preparing for my solo Thanksgiving ride.

237
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:31,817
I was at the gym.

238
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:35,421
Ava's birthday/Thanksgiving
dinner's a high-caloric affair.

239
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,156
Terry needs to earn that feast.

240
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:40,326
Everybody has an alibi. How convenient.

241
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:44,163
So I hope you're comfortable
because I will keep you in here

242
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:46,599
all day if necessary!

243
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:48,334
We need the room to question someone

244
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:50,102
- about the Red Hook homicide.
- Oh, no problem.

245
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:53,439
- We'll be right out.
- Okay, we are one glass in.

246
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:55,208
My mom's telling a story about my birth

247
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,243
and your parents are not recoiling.

248
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:59,746
Good. Let's keep it going.
I think we need to top 'em off.

249
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:01,214
A-top them off.

250
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,082
Every night I'm told what to do

251
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:04,984
and every morning I do what I'm told,

252
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,220
but yet I cannot escape your scold.

253
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,089
What am I? An alarm clock.

254
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:13,392
Oh, I get it. So a riddle
is just like a fact

255
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,094
that's told in a really confusing way.

256
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,496
- Exactly.
- Hey, I used to fly

257
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:20,399
- with Sully Sullenberger.
- What he did was amazing.

258
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,069
Between us, I could have landed
that plane on the ground

259
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,972
at the destination without
killing any of those birds.

260
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:29,675
Is my dad playing piano?

261
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,344
And is my dad scatting?

262
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:35,114
- This is amazing.
- Oh, my.

263
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,682
Who wants more wine?

264
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,451
No, no, no, no, no more for me.

265
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:40,671
In fact, I think everyone here
has had enough.

266
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:42,121
- We have?
- Yes.

267
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:44,891
Now we're drinking this.

268
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,159
Rum from Cuba.

269
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:50,229
Rum from Cuba!

270
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:52,064
I saw what you did this morning

271
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,133
when you deduced the
contents of my bakery box.

272
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:56,636
Impressive.
Now I need to use your skills

273
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,304
to find my pie.

274
00:09:58,339 --> 00:09:59,972
It's about time you came to us.

275
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:02,285
Here's what we need from you.
A list of the pie's ingredients.

276
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:03,843
We're looking for anything
that might linger

277
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,060
- on someone's breath.
- We need surveillance footage

278
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:08,489
from the water fountain,
the crumb consistency was dry.

279
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,786
Whoever ate it's gonna be thirsty.

280
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:11,450
Now what kind of crimped edge
are we dealing with here?

281
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,486
- U-shaped or V?
- I don't know.

282
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:15,388
Well, then get on the damned phone

283
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,199
and find out.

284
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:21,661
Babe, our parents are vibing hard.

285
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:24,315
Drinking just makes people
get along better.

286
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:26,406
Do you think if I got my parents drunk
every day when I was a kid

287
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:28,234
they would have stayed together
and we would have had a happy family?

288
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,002
- Probably. Yeah.
- Right. Yeah.

289
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:31,972
I'd like to say a few words.

290
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:35,560
Camila and I thrilled to
welcome you into our family,

291
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:39,578
so allow me to be the first to
bless this union with a toast.

292
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:42,615
- To Jake and Amy.
- To Jake and Amy.

293
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,383
Aww, thanks, Dad. That was really sweet.

294
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,352
- I have a toast too.
- Oh.

295
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:50,156
Karen and I would like
to welcome you into our family.

296
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:54,360
And allow me to be the first
to say that we love you.

297
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:56,228
To Jake and Amy. Congratulations.

298
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:57,697
To Jake and Amy.

299
00:10:57,732 --> 00:10:59,265
- Thanks, Dad.
- I'd like to go again.

300
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,666
Uh-oh, they're getting competitive.

301
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,435
It goes without saying, I love you both.

302
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,971
- But you didn't say it.
- I'd just like to add,

303
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:06,973
if there's anything you ever need,

304
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:08,708
the Santiago's are here for you.

305
00:11:08,776 --> 00:11:10,643
- To Jake and Amy.
- Round two.

306
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:12,378
Oh, that seems like plenty, Dad.

307
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:13,546
No, if Victor gets two toasts,

308
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:15,348
then I do too.

309
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,483
I would like to go one
step further and say that

310
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:21,087
if there is anything
that you need or want

311
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:23,255
the Peralta's are there for you.

312
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,991
That doesn't sound like
a better offer than mine.

313
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,525
Yeah, it is.

314
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,060
It's a lot better than yours.

315
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:29,190
Jake...

316
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,331
I'll give you my grandfather's watch.

317
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:34,000
You are now a Santiago.

318
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:35,534
I would like to pay for the wedding.

319
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,203
Amy, you are now my daughter.

320
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,604
- What?
- I win.

321
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,272
To Jake and Amy.

322
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,641
Oh, no. There are downsides to alcohol.

323
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:46,801
Well, that was
a lovely series of toasts,

324
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:49,004
Now who can I interest
in 12 cups of coffee?

325
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,397
No, I'd like to know what Roger meant

326
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:52,807
when he said he would pay
for the wedding.

327
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:54,413
How much are you willing to give them?

328
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:56,382
- Whatever they need.
- You know it's tradition

329
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:58,246
- for the bride's family to pay.
- It's also tradition

330
00:11:58,281 --> 00:11:59,748
for the host to make the turkey.

331
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:01,850
- Okay, guys...
- Bottom line is,

332
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:03,952
we appreciate the offer,
but we're paying.

333
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:06,321
No, you gave him the watch.
That was your gift.

334
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:08,074
Maybe we should just split the wedding.

335
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,476
It's a great idea, Mom.

336
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,259
Given your financial situation.

337
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:13,161
- No.
- What's that supposed to mean?

338
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:15,096
Our financial "situation"?

339
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:16,898
You know, I think we probably all had

340
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:18,867
just about enough of this delicious rum.

341
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:20,235
I'm gonna dump it out into this plant.

342
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,936
That's a $600 bottle.

343
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:24,606
$527. I looked it up online.

344
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:27,842
If you paid $600, you're making
some bad choices, my friend.

345
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:31,880
All right, it's dinner time.
Everybody go wash your hands.

346
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:33,848
I'd never said that before.
Amy, you come with me.

347
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:35,650
This is a nightmare.

348
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:37,652
This is worse than
my sixth birthday party

349
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:39,320
when I caught my dad making out
with a female clown

350
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:41,322
in the bounce house.
Oh, my dad is the worst.

351
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:43,224
I know. He's ruining the whole day.

352
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,244
Yeah, but, you know,

353
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,562
don't just blame my dad.

354
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:48,897
You literally just said he's the worst.

355
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:50,353
I know. It's okay when I say it.

356
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:52,098
You have to pretend like he's cool.
Those are the rules.

357
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:53,127
Plus, you gotta admit,

358
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,303
your parents were being
a little condescending.

359
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,205
Why? Because they asked
what was in the dip

360
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,207
- that seemed to be just mayo?
- All dip is just mayo.

361
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:01,676
Yes, but no, what I was
referring to was the fact that

362
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:03,712
your mom brought her own hand towels.

363
00:13:03,747 --> 00:13:05,180
As if my mom wouldn't
have washed hers knowing

364
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:06,881
- they had guests coming over?
- Did she?

365
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,616
No, you don't have to.

366
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:09,918
They're only touched
by freshly cleaned hands.

367
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:11,352
- They never get dirty.
- Wow.

368
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:12,821
The unhygienic apple doesn't fall far

369
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:14,222
from the unhygienic tree.

370
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:15,690
Did you just call my mom a tree?

371
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:16,925
I called her an unhygienic tree.

372
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,644
Wow. Wow.

373
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:21,019
All right, you know what?

374
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:23,131
Let's just go back in there

375
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,066
and enjoy our joyous Thanksgiving

376
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:27,569
and hopefully no one's
parents will ruin it.

377
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:29,070
Fine. Well, I know that my parents

378
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:30,672
aren't gonna ruin any joyousness.

379
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:32,273
In fact, they're gonna be
joyous as hell.

380
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:34,816
Not nearly as joyous as my parents.

381
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:37,178
<i>Thank you, all, for joining me.</i>

382
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:38,613
I checked into your alibis.

383
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:40,115
Or should I say...

384
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,916
alib-lies!

385
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:43,985
Diaz, if you were changing
the oil in your bike

386
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,987
for your big ride up the coast,
then tell me,

387
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:48,556
why is your tank only half full?

388
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:51,259
- You dipsticked my bike?
- That's not all I dipsticked.

389
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:53,728
Mr. Fit, or should I call you
by your real name?

390
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:56,197
Mr. Fib. I find it quite odd

391
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,899
that you were building up
an appetite at the gym

392
00:13:57,934 --> 00:14:00,802
when your gym is closed on Thanksgiving.

393
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:02,804
And, Boyle, out buying goose feet

394
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:04,205
- for Nickolaj?
- Nikolaj.

395
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,207
I found your grocery store receipt.

396
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:08,977
No feet of any kind.
But there was one purchase,

397
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:11,880
a beverage that pairs
perfectly with pie.

398
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:14,249
One gallon of milk!

399
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:16,017
This heist took three people.

400
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:19,320
Lady Dipstick, Mr. Fib,
and the Milk Man.

401
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:22,624
The jig is up. Confess.

402
00:14:22,952 --> 00:14:24,317
- Okay, I lied.
- Thank you.

403
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:25,894
Not about the pie.
About my Thanksgiving.

404
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:28,029
I'm not spending it alone.
I'm spending it with my family.

405
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:30,245
We're seeing the new
"Minions" musical on Broadway.

406
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,834
And I wasn't putting oil in my bike.

407
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:35,770
I was picking up these matching
T-shirts for my whole family.

408
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:37,572
I missed my family a lot

409
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:39,500
when I was in prison and we've
gotten really close again.

410
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:41,402
I was embarrassed about
how pumped I am to see them.

411
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:43,077
The T-shirts were my idea.

412
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,853
Okay. It was a two-man job.

413
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,822
No, I didn't steal your pie either.

414
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:50,652
I lied about the gym because
I was still trying to find

415
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:52,486
a Perry the Parrot for Ava.

416
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:54,155
I forgot it was her birthday coming up

417
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:57,495
and by the time I realized,
the dumb toy was all sold out.

418
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,694
I just didn't want you guys to know

419
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:01,896
what a horrible dad I really am.

420
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:03,731
Well, now we do. Boyle?

421
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:05,680
Nikolaj is a picky eater!

422
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:08,970
I lied about his palate.
All he drinks is milk.

423
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:11,539
All he eats is buttered noodles.

424
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:13,641
- And perhaps my walnut pie?
- I wish.

425
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:17,111
He hates nuts. My son is a basic bitch.

426
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:19,212
So none of you took my pie.

427
00:15:19,248 --> 00:15:21,316
Captain, you're gonna wanna see this.

428
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:23,151
Their desks were clean,

429
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:25,787
so we expanded the search radius.

430
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:27,088
Take a look.

431
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:29,023
My pie, and it wasn't even eaten.

432
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:31,960
Just thrown away
like common street trash.

433
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:34,696
Makes me sick.
Spend your life on the force,

434
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,564
and it never gets easier.

435
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,067
Wow, Mom, what a delightful dinner.

436
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:40,902
I mean, these have gotta be
the most joyous green beans

437
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:43,605
- I've ever seen.
- Oh, thanks, honey.

438
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,607
- They're pre-made from a can.
- Great.

439
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:47,709
Shall we carve the turkey?
Get this dinner started?

440
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:50,543
I'm an excellent carver. Allow me.

441
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:51,649
I think I can carve the turkey.

442
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:52,984
After all, it is my house

443
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,682
and sitting right here in front of me.

444
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:56,517
We have two turkeys.

445
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,187
- You can both carve one.
- Yes, thank goodness

446
00:15:59,222 --> 00:16:01,956
for the second turkey, a very
normal thing to have brought.

447
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:04,592
This is actually very good
because now everybody could see

448
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:07,120
- who cuts the turkey better.
- You're on.

449
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:09,864
- Wow. Really mature.
- You're just saying that

450
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,314
because you know my dad's gonna win.

451
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,217
- As if.
- Hey, Roger,

452
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:15,096
You like jokes. Here's one.

453
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:17,135
I'd hate to be a passenger
on one of your flights

454
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:19,063
if you fly as slow as you cut a turkey.

455
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:21,657
Riddle me this, Victor.
Who sucks at carving turkey,

456
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,537
thinks their rum is good when it's bad?

457
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:25,327
You. Up top, Jake.

458
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:26,981
- Joyous.
- Uh, Camila,

459
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:28,983
did you put your stuffing in my ceramic?

460
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,586
- I thought it was a bowl.
- It's art.

461
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:33,581
What does that mean?

462
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,467
- What did she say?
- She said it was a bowl.

463
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:37,051
Bet you didn't know
I understood Spanish.

464
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:39,694
Very impressive. You learn that
from one of your mistresses?

465
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:42,512
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I did.
Sounds like someone's jealous.

466
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:45,334
- I bet you never even had sex.
- Oh, I've had sex.

467
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,310
And I'm actually pretty good. Camila?

468
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:49,199
- The best.
- What is happening right now?

469
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:51,101
Roger's really good at sex too.

470
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:53,535
- Ha, ha, I'm so grossed out.
- You know what?

471
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:57,438
I'm sick of you
looking down your nose at us.

472
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,126
I know the Peralta's aren't perfect,

473
00:16:59,162 --> 00:17:00,999
but we don't look down on other people.

474
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:03,447
I mean, you come into our home
and you act like we're idiots.

475
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,111
Well, we're not idiots. In fact...

476
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:07,020
- I just cut my thumb off.
- What?

477
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:08,455
I just cut my thumb off.

478
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:11,960
Oh, my God!

479
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:15,109
I think it's... It's bad.

480
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,832
Excuse me, my father cut his thumb off.

481
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:19,672
- We need help right now.
- Do you have the thumb?

482
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,823
Yeah, I got it right here.

483
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,409
It's in a plastic baggy.

484
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:23,453
It's not just sitting on the ice cream.

485
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:24,930
Okay, just fill out these forms.

486
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:26,398
Someone will be with you in a bit.

487
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,314
I think this might
be it for me, little man.

488
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,049
There's something you gotta know, Jake.

489
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:32,103
- You have three half-sisters.
- What?

490
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:33,508
One in Atlanta, one in Newark,

491
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:35,274
one in Dallas Fort Worth. All the hubs.

492
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,076
Okay, we have to get him help right now.

493
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:38,743
He can't die. I've gotta
hear more about this.

494
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:41,478
It's a holiday, we're understaffed,
we'll get to your father eventually.

495
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:43,280
He needs help now!

496
00:17:43,316 --> 00:17:45,599
You know who this man is?
Captain Roger Peralta.

497
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:47,267
He taught Sully Sullenberger how to fly.

498
00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:49,065
It's just that we're understaffed.

499
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,003
No excuses.
You're going to take this man

500
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,442
to the OR right now or I'm gonna sue you

501
00:17:53,478 --> 00:17:55,575
and everybody in this hospital.

502
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:57,194
Uh, go with him.

503
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,713
- I love you, buddy.
- Oh.

504
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:01,948
- Thanks, that's nice.
- I love you, nurse.

505
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:04,202
I love you lady in the scarf.

506
00:18:04,238 --> 00:18:05,585
Significantly less meaningful.

507
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:08,336
- I love you candy machine.
- Victor, that was amazing.

508
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:09,923
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Of course.

509
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:11,850
Your mom and Camila are on the way.

510
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:13,652
They're still cleaning up all the blood.

511
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:15,462
Yeah, there was so much.
They might have to move.

512
00:18:15,497 --> 00:18:18,265
Babe, I'm really sorry
about all the things I said.

513
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,467
- You know, I didn't mean it.
- Yeah, me neither.

514
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:21,968
And, look, this is all my fault.

515
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,473
I just wanted a big family Thanksgiving,
and I forced it, so it's on me.

516
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:27,841
But, look, I love you, and...

517
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:29,342
Is that still your dad's thumb?

518
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:31,711
Oh, my God, yes. He needs this. Nurse?

519
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,987
Hello, Raymond. Ready to go to dinner?

520
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:37,217
Yes, but I have some
unfortunate news about our pie.

521
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:38,916
- It was thrown away.
- No.

522
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,608
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

523
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:42,517
- And I know who did it.
- Who?

524
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:45,956
You all bragged about
your Thanksgiving plans.

525
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,684
Why? You were overcompensating.

526
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,050
Trying to cover up your dark secrets,

527
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:56,811
but there was one other person
who was also overcompensating.

528
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:58,647
You. Kevin.

529
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:00,291
Even better than a plain scone.

530
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:02,242
Plain scone. Plain scone.

531
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:03,777
I should have known you were lying.

532
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:06,229
There's nothing better
than a plain scone.

533
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:08,281
- This is ridiculous.
- Is it?

534
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:10,134
Look how the pie was disposed of.

535
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,352
Placed gently with two hands
inside the bin.

536
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:14,387
That's exactly how
you always throw away garbage.

537
00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:15,889
- It is?
- There's only one thing

538
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:18,095
I still can't figure out.

539
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:20,629
- Why'd you do it?
- Because it's disgusting.

540
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:22,231
- Oh, my.
- That pie is an abomination.

541
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,523
It has beef suet and apple seeds in it.

542
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,263
Why? It's a walnut pie.

543
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,683
If we brought that to my family's house,
hey would have said something.

544
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:32,019
- I was trying to protect you.
- Why didn't you just tell me the truth?

545
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:34,374
Because I love our annual trips

546
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:35,842
to Saratoga Springs.

547
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,577
The two of us driving in silence,

548
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:39,446
looking at the barren trees.
It's perfect.

549
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:42,404
I... I didn't wanna lose that.

550
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:45,285
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know why we can't

551
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,420
still make the drive next year.

552
00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:49,684
We just don't have to buy the pie.

553
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,458
A trip with no purpose?

554
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:53,470
Raymond...

555
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:56,329
- Hey, Dad, how's it going?
- I'm fine.

556
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:58,389
They reattached my thumb.

557
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,859
Oh, that's great.
So you'll be able to fly again?

558
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,328
Yeah, that was never in doubt.

559
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,964
You don't need thumbs to fly anymore.
You just hit one button.

560
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,325
The plane takes care of the rest.

561
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:07,741
I have to believe that's not true.

562
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:09,709
Oh, looks like Mom's
already tuckered out.

563
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:11,644
Yeah, you know how tired
she gets when she drinks.

564
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,946
- She won't be up for 12 hours.
- Hey, Jake,

565
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:15,348
you know how you said
you always wanted to have

566
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:17,717
a big family Thanksgiving?
I had five brothers,

567
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:20,387
three sisters, four aunts,
and 12 cousins

568
00:20:20,422 --> 00:20:22,622
who spent every holiday together.

569
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:24,591
I had the kind of family
that you dream of.

570
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:27,659
Oh, are you done?

571
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:29,023
That seemed like
a really mean place to stop,

572
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:30,296
but you're taking a long pause.

573
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:31,331
- When we all were together...
- Ah.

574
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:32,699
Huge mess. I can't tell you

575
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,601
how many holidays I spent in an ER.

576
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:35,769
But that's what it means

577
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:37,437
to have a big family.

578
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:38,872
Like this one.

579
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:41,558
Oh. Well, thank you, Victor.

580
00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:43,527
And apparently my family's
a lot bigger than I thought.

581
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:45,220
How many half sisters
did you say I have, Dad?

582
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:46,659
I only told you about the sisters?

583
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:48,719
- Come on.
- Roger, I want to apologize

584
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:49,899
to you for being so defensive

585
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:51,345
about you wanting
to pay for the wedding.

586
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:53,319
I'm sorry too. It was stupid.

587
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:54,821
I was just feeling insecure because...

588
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:56,489
'Cause I gave Jake the watch?

589
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:58,892
I was gonna say because you saw
my penis through my underpants,

590
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:00,627
but the watch, yeah, sure.

591
00:21:00,662 --> 00:21:02,896
I was thinking, if you wanna
pay for the wedding,

592
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:05,865
it would be fine, but we can split it.

593
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,567
It's up to you.

594
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,436
That seems fair.

595
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:12,556
You're a good dude.
Come here, give me a hug.

596
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:14,683
Give me a... hug me. Hug me.

597
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:17,610
- Bring it in.
- Oh, Jake, it's happening.

598
00:21:17,646 --> 00:21:19,345
The weird but good dad hug.

599
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:20,880
Oh, it's magical.

600
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,816
Best Thanksgiving ever.

601
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:24,812
Yep, Dad, your gown's riding up.

602
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,147
- Oh.
- It's out.

603
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:27,632
- Ooh, I...
- It's out.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

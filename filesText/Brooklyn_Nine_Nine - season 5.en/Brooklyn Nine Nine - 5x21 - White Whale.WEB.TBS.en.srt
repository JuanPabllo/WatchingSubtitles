1
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:04,313
I am so sick of this city.

2
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:05,614
I go into a coffee shop,

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,424
and as soon as everybody
sees that I'm a cop,

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,856
they stop talking and they
avoid eye contact with me.

5
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:11,586
One lady even walked out.

6
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:13,555
I am just so tired of being treated

7
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:14,857
- like the enemy...
- Hey, Hitchcock?

8
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,331
Your penis is hanging out.

9
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:18,093
Oh. Well, that's a relief.

00:00:38,117 --> 00:00:41,572
All right, there are
seven days until the wedding,

12
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,351
so we are officially transitioning

13
00:00:43,387 --> 00:00:46,369
from the "Month Of" binder to...

14
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:49,184
- "Week Of" binder.
- My goodness.

15
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:50,408
- They're getting bigger.
- You should see

16
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:51,477
- the honeymoon binder.
- Ooh.

17
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:52,746
Is there a tab for sex stuff?

18
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:54,348
Several. And they're cascading.

19
00:00:54,384 --> 00:00:55,697
- Yeah, they are.
- Today's our only day off

20
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,533
before Saturday. We have 24 hours

21
00:00:57,568 --> 00:00:59,368
to accomplish a week's worth
of wedding prep.

22
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:00,836
This is what getting married
is all about.

23
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:02,538
And spending your life
with your soul mate.

24
00:01:02,573 --> 00:01:03,794
Uh-huh. Hey, Rosa,

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,350
why do you have a picture
of Sergio Mindar up?

26
00:01:05,386 --> 00:01:07,642
Facial recognition picked
him up at JFK yesterday.

27
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:09,812
He finally resurfaced after seven years.

28
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:12,248
- Who's Sergio Mindar?
- The bane of my existence.

29
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:15,202
Bane from "Batman", right?

30
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:16,605
Continue.

31
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:18,721
He's a ruthless killer
who built a meth empire.

32
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:20,915
We were tracking him for weeks,
but he kept getting away.

33
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:22,580
Finally, we cornered him in a warehouse.

34
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,260
Every exit was covered
and he just vanished.

35
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:28,030
Then he sent us a postcard
from Paraguay a year later

36
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:30,466
just to taunt us. It was diabolical.

37
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,401
Yeah, it was full of grammar errors...

38
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:34,737
and other taunts that
normal people care about.

39
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:36,839
That was the first time
I was the primary on a case.

40
00:01:36,874 --> 00:01:38,607
The fact that I let him
get away still haunts me.

41
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:39,942
He's been in every dream I've had

42
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:41,123
for the last seven years.

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,392
Even the one you told me about

44
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:43,427
where you're flying on a marshmallow?

45
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:44,929
Who do you think was riding

46
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:45,943
- the jellybean I was chasing?
- Mindar.

47
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,447
Well, you won't be haunted any longer

48
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:48,837
because we're gonna catch him.

49
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,653
Rosa, I'm working this case with you.

50
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:52,621
Jake, I know we have a ton
of wedding stuff to do, but...

51
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:54,356
No, no, no.
You absolutely have to do this.

52
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:56,725
He's your white whale.
He's your Johnny Franzia.

53
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:58,360
- Who?
- My archnemesis?

54
00:01:58,396 --> 00:01:59,695
Johnny Franzia? The guy who's been

55
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,630
tormenting me with
a deck of cards for years?

56
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,928
"Looks like deuces are wild, Peralta"?

57
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,449
Seriously? I feel like I talk

58
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:07,185
about him constantly,
but it doesn't matter.

59
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:08,904
You definitely have to go.
I'll handle the wedding stuff.

60
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,038
Are you sure?

61
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,233
It's a lot to get done in one day.

62
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:12,468
Absolutely. You work the case,

63
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:14,004
and hey, if you guys need any pointers

64
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,506
on a cool high five
or something, I could...

65
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,337
Well, if you need
any suggestions, let me know.

66
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:23,686
- This all looks fine.
- Charles, shh.

67
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:24,987
- I wasn't talking.
- Shh!

68
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:26,889
Olivia Crawford just
got off the elevator.

69
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:28,524
My rival for the commissionership?

70
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,459
She's here right now?
I've got to come up

71
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:32,494
with a confident opening salvo.

72
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,697
Think, Raymond. Think.

73
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:35,998
- Hello, Raymond.
- Olivia.

74
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,073
You have a little bit of...

75
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:39,835
goop in your eye.

76
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,976
Oh, thank you.

77
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:43,305
I'm sorry to barge in like this,

78
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:44,873
but I have a source
on the nominating committee.

79
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:46,408
They're making their recommendation

80
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:47,977
to the mayor at the end of next week,

81
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:49,878
and it seems that John Kelly

82
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:51,780
is going to beat out both of us.

83
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:53,248
Big shocker.

84
00:02:53,284 --> 00:02:54,850
The straight white man wins again.

85
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:56,251
- Exactly.
- Amen.

86
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,586
That was my complaint

87
00:02:57,621 --> 00:02:58,988
about Owen winning "Top Chef Junior,"

88
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:00,522
and you guys all acted like I was crazy.

89
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:02,725
Half of the committee
supports John Kelly,

90
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,427
and the other half is divided
between the two of us.

91
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:07,496
We're splitting the vote.
So for either of us

92
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:09,631
to have a chance,
one of us needs to step aside.

93
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:10,933
Exactly. You should drop out.

94
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:11,967
...is what you said to yourself

95
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:13,535
in the mirror this morning

96
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:14,770
instead of checking your eye for goop.

97
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:16,705
And I agree. You should drop out.

98
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:18,040
...is what you said
to yourself in the mirror

99
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:20,009
this morning while polishing your head.

100
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:21,543
Don't you think it's time New York had

101
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,278
its first female commissioner?

102
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:24,747
What about its first openly
gay commissioner?

103
00:03:24,782 --> 00:03:26,815
Yes, that would be vital and important

104
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:28,751
if you weren't 1 million years old.

105
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:32,454
You do know that exaggeration
is the "huckster's crutch"?

106
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,423
Also, I come off quite youthful.

107
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,025
You just said "huckster's crutch."

108
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,245
Step aside... Grandpa.

109
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:42,614
Hey, hey, Sarge.

110
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,566
Large and in charge like El DeBarge.

111
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:46,001
Quick "quesht":

112
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:48,404
how would you like to spend
your day off with me,

113
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,040
doing an endless list of wedding tasks?

114
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:52,641
I can see from your eyes,
you're excited.

115
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:54,443
No way. Sharon and the girls are going

116
00:03:54,478 --> 00:03:56,979
on a playdate all day
and I'm going to see a movie

117
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:58,781
for grown-ups. No talking animals

118
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:00,373
and tons of cuss words.

119
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:01,850
I know cuss words.
Come with me and I'll cuss

120
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:03,452
at you all day long,
you big piece of crap.

121
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:04,787
Yeah, that sounds fun, but I'm gonna

122
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:05,888
- stick with the movie.
- No, no, no.

123
00:04:05,923 --> 00:04:07,456
Please don't do that. Look...

124
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:08,957
I promised Amy I could
get everything done,

125
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:11,360
and I definitely can't.
Breaking promises is how

126
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:12,828
marriages end, not how they start!

127
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:15,931
- What is that?
- I have 143 tasks

128
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:17,433
to get through in the next 12 hours.

129
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:18,867
I set a recurring alarm
so I know how fast

130
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:20,369
- I should be moving.
- Well, how's that going?

131
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:22,037
Not well. I'm already three tasks behind

132
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:24,473
and the alarms keep piling up.
It's kind of making me feel

133
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:26,442
a little bit stressed out.
Please help me, Sarge.

134
00:04:26,477 --> 00:04:27,509
Please. Come on, you're, like,

135
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:28,944
the best husband ever.

136
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,679
You're, like, the Tiger Woods
of being a husband.

137
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:32,548
What he was to golf, not what
he was to being a husband.

138
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,594
Terry's husband game is flawless.

139
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:37,386
- Okay, I'm in... but you owe me.
- Yes!

140
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:39,388
Anything you want. Now, let's roll out,

141
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,494
you friggin' dick!

142
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,029
Wait, you don't have to cuss at me, man.

143
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:43,498
No, it's too late.
It's already locked in.

144
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:45,060
God, looking at these old files

145
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:46,795
is really bringing back some memories.

146
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:49,431
Sergio's evil voice, his stupid face...

147
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,566
His delicious aroma.

148
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:52,134
Man, I hated how good he smelled.

149
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:53,138
I know.

150
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:54,607
That jerk smelled like
an English garden.

151
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:56,813
He almost made me quit
the force, but my God,

152
00:04:56,941 --> 00:04:59,316
- I could breathe him in for days.
- Why do you think he came back?

153
00:04:59,352 --> 00:05:01,009
According to this picture from JFK,

154
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:02,511
he's taking the bus, so I'm guessing

155
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:03,946
- he's out of money in Paraguay.
- Right.

156
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:05,447
Didn't his number two say
he had to leave a bunch

157
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:06,915
of his cash behind before he fled?

158
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,282
Hey, look at this.

159
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:10,986
Sergio's getting on the B15.
That goes to Bed-Stuy

160
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:13,655
via Garvey Avenue, where he had...

161
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,090
a hideout in an old brownstone.

162
00:05:15,126 --> 00:05:16,492
I don't know. You think he's dumb enough

163
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:17,793
- to go back there?
- Yeah, I do.

164
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:18,994
You know why?

165
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,562
'Cause he forgot who was on his tail.

166
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:21,930
Nope, he remembered.

167
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,432
And he used the wrong "you're"

168
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,601
- and the wrong "too"!
- Son of a bitch!

169
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:28,746
Ugh! Damn it, he still smells great.

170
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:34,499
How is this guy always
one step ahead of us?

171
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,826
God, I hate him!

172
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:38,070
- Ow! My noggin!
- Oh, no.

173
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,139
It's happening again.
This is exactly like last time.

174
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,041
No, it's not. What makes you say that?

175
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,809
God, I hate him!

176
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,611
Ow! My noggin!

177
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,113
Okay, fine.
But not everything is the same.

178
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,481
Honestly, the only thing
that's different

179
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:50,549
is Hitchcock's hair.

180
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,817
Ow! My noggin!

181
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,453
How dare you, Diaz?

182
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,923
Oh, I miss that toupee.
You know it was a reversible?

183
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,858
No, you know what else is different?

184
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:02,628
We're better cops now. Look, Sergio knew

185
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:03,780
that we knew about that hideout.

186
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:05,698
It was listed in his
original arrest warrant.

187
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,232
Right. We need to find a connection

188
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:08,901
to him that he doesn't know
that we know about.

189
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,063
Wait.

190
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,970
What about his grandmother?

191
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:13,706
She was the last person he visited

192
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:14,873
- before he fled.
- I don't know.

193
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,508
I'm just not sure we'll be able

194
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,943
to get some old bag to squeal
on her grandson.

195
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,812
Clearly, you've never
seen me with the elderly.

196
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,547
They love me.

197
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,816
I can talk about coupons for days, son.

198
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,701
That's right, you're looking
at a senior queen.

199
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,788
What is that?
That's not a widely used term.

200
00:06:29,824 --> 00:06:31,223
Jake, you gotta pick a napkin.

201
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,891
The binder said they should be beige.

202
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:35,094
I didn't realize there'd
be 45 different shades.

203
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,097
"Chanterelle," "desert whimsy,"
"filbert husk"?

204
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,865
Words have no more meaning, Terry.

205
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,087
We're running out of time, man.

206
00:06:41,123 --> 00:06:42,885
- You gotta make a call.
- But what if I choose wrong?

207
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,703
That's a terrible way
to start off a marriage.

208
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,205
People won't even watch our first dance.

209
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,173
They're gonna be too busy
laughing at the napkins.

210
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,009
Okay... maybe I can narrow it down.

211
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,382
Uh, I think I don't like desert whimsy.

212
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,280
- Okay.
- Why did you pause like that

213
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:57,017
before you said "okay"?
Was that secretly your favorite one?

214
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:58,907
Look, you know Amy better than anyone.

215
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:00,361
You just have to trust your gut.

216
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:01,687
What is your gut telling you?

217
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,088
That I'm a terrible napkin chooser

218
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,623
and will therefore be a horrible spouse.

219
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,158
That is not your gut.
That is your crazy,

220
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,926
nonsense brain. Trust me, Jake.

221
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,229
You know the right napkin.
Is it this one?

222
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,164
With that crimping? No way.

223
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,099
- Oh, my God, what did I just do?
- You listened to your gut!

224
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:15,834
Yes! I have a gut! My groom gut!

225
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,036
Every groom has one.
You just had to find yours.

226
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:20,873
Okay, I can do this.
Uh, this one's too big.

227
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,208
This is too scratchy.
This one is shedding.

228
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:25,177
This one's too rustic.
Am I using that term right?

229
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,012
Yes, you're doing it! It is too rustic!

230
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,715
This one. Classy, but very absorbent.

231
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,850
Simple, and it won't clash
with our color scheme.

232
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,252
It's perfect! We'll take it!

233
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,921
- Groom gut!
- Groom gut!

234
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,289
Did you hear anything from Olivia?

235
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,091
She's not gonna step down,
and neither am I.

236
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,859
- We're at an impasse.
- Okay.

237
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,761
Well, Gina and I have been
discussing the situation

238
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,863
and we think we know
what you need to do.

239
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,065
- Oh? What is that?
- Whisper campaign.

240
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,901
It's the best way to bring down an enemy

241
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,669
if you don't wanna get your hands dirty.

242
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,938
How do you think I stole
the cheese club presidency

243
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,174
- away from Bruce?
- Whisper.

244
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,662
I heard he thought
camembert was goat cheese.

245
00:07:57,698 --> 00:07:59,683
And how do you think I got Janet

246
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:01,585
and her horrible daughter
Dakota to drop out

247
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:04,121
- of baby bongos class?
- Whispers.

248
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:06,724
I heard Dakota has
foot in mouth disease.

249
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,954
Sir, you have to give us
permission to do this.

250
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,389
Weaponize our sweet little mouths.

251
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,398
Ugh, how are we on
the same side of this?

252
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:14,501
This is not a strategy
I'd normally entertain,

253
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,995
however, challenging Olivia publicly

254
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:19,798
is out of the question, so...
what do you have in mind?

255
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:21,700
- Whispers.
- Yes, I know,

256
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,035
but what specifically are the words

257
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,403
that you would be whispering?

258
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,104
She lied on her resume.

259
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,707
- She's a shoplifter.
- She planted evidence.

260
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:32,177
- She seduced a priest.
- She pads her stats.

261
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:34,112
She's sort of stanky, I heard.

262
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:36,114
No, no. I wanna be commissioner

263
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,952
of the NYPD, but I want
to achieve it honorably.

264
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,019
There has to be another way.

265
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:42,254
There isn't.

266
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,331
Whispers.

267
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:47,888
So Louise Mindar is
right over there, officers.

268
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:49,190
Oh, please don't call us that.

269
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:51,096
- We're undercover.
- Yeah, we're pretending

270
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,431
we like old people
and don't think they're gross.

271
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,966
Some of us aren't pretending.

272
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,301
I think the elderly
are treasured to society.

273
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,937
Actually, from experience,
she is more right.

274
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,205
You definitely shouldn't
be working here,

275
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:02,010
but thank you for your help.

276
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:06,029
All right, Rosa, time for
some senior seduction.

277
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,884
Hello, Mrs. Mindar.
We're from Sunset for Seniors,

278
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,352
and we're here to brighten your day.

279
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,967
- Where's my regular girl?
- Oh, she's sick.

280
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:17,469
Appendicitis.

281
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:19,123
Oh, Frank's niece just had that.

282
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,126
- Hi, I'm Eunice.
- Hi, Eunice.

283
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,761
- We're talking to Louise.
- Oh...

284
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,997
So, I have a really fun
activity for today.

285
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,774
- We are going to...
- You know what?

286
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,177
I was wrong. Frank's niece
had a botched uterus.

287
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:30,912
Thank you for that visual, Eunice.

288
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:32,881
I thought we could do
an oral history project

289
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,161
on your family. Wouldn't that be a hoot?

290
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:36,575
Oh, I guess so.

291
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:38,944
Well, I was born during the Depression,

292
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,813
and I had to sleep in a dresser
drawer till I was three.

293
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,315
Yeah, this is more of a recent history.

294
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,150
Like, in the last week or so,
have you had any visits

295
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,319
- from family?
- I don't have any relatives,

296
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,887
except for my grandson,

297
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,789
who I haven't seen in seven years.

298
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,125
Thank you for reminding me of that.

299
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,493
Yeah, we all have family problems.

300
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,128
The question is, are you
going to see him soon?

301
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,497
How do I know? He never calls me.

302
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,546
My turn.

303
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:00,614
I was born in the Depression too,

304
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,617
but we were extremely rich.

305
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,103
- We had a chambermaid.
- Not now, Eunice.

306
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:07,406
Okay, so we are way behind.

307
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,341
Picking out napkins took up
a shockingly large part

308
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,143
of the day, which is funny,
because in my regular life,

309
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,078
- I don't use napkins ever.
- That's gross,

310
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,014
but the good news is,
your groom gut is all fired up.

311
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,116
She sure is, and she's hungry for tasks.

312
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,885
- Your groom gut is a woman?
- Yeah, why?

313
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,753
- I think it's really cool.
- Oh, thanks!

314
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,155
All right, let's crush this list.

315
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,523
Calla lilies? Do you think I'm planning

316
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:27,020
a funeral? I want dahlias.

317
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,828
No, no, no. Brown sprinkles

318
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,163
at the ice cream bar?

319
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,197
Do you think I'm planning a funeral?

320
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,620
Give me rainbow!

321
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:34,955
Mini lamb shanks?

322
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:36,257
Do you think I'm planning a funeral?

323
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:38,907
Swap 'em out for some tiny tuna tacos.

324
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,440
Why do you keep saying
the funeral thing?

325
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,108
Because my groom gut has a catchphrase.

326
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,443
Doy.

327
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,244
Hey, Sarge, look at this!

328
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,146
I cleared all my alarms. We're amazing!

329
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:49,848
Should we start a business
where we just become

330
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,783
professional choosers?
We could call it...

331
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,385
- "Pro-Choice Industries."
- Jake?

332
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,989
You're right, that name
is needlessly political,

333
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:56,334
but the business idea is solid.

334
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,303
No, I'm not talking about that.
All those decisions you made?

335
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,005
You are way over budget.

336
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:04,579
Oh, no. My groom gut is a fancy bitch.

337
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,065
Well, our only lead turned to crap.

338
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:09,267
Let me go back in there.
I just need a little more time

339
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:11,103
with Louise. Did you see Eunice?

340
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,404
She was practically humping my leg.

341
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,040
No, dude, it's over. We lost Sergio.

342
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,042
Oh, God, I just wanna crush something.

343
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,411
- Look, we will find him.
- No, we won't.

344
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,279
I thought I was a better cop
than I was seven years ago,

345
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:23,015
but I'm not. I'm still the same loser

346
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,625
who lost him back then. Stupid loser!

347
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,553
That's very wasteful.

348
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,559
Thank you for your wisdom.
Greatest generation.

349
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:33,828
Look, you didn't lose him back then.

350
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:35,560
Yes, I did. I had him cornered

351
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:36,828
- and I lost him.
- No.

352
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:37,842
I lost him.

353
00:11:37,878 --> 00:11:40,111
I'm the one who let him
get away the first time.

354
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,300
- What?
- When we had him cornered

355
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,136
in that warehouse,
you told me to cover the back.

356
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,538
I thought I heard something on
the roof and I left my post.

357
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,273
You always wondered how he got away?

358
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,572
I let him. It was my fault.

359
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,913
- And I never told you.
- Seriously?

360
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,215
Hey, Louise Mindar has
been signed out of the building

361
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,584
for a therapy appointment,
but she doesn't do therapy

362
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,853
and hasn't left the premises in years.

363
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,488
Oh, my God, she must
be going to see Sergio.

364
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:05,190
- Maybe.
- Definitely!

365
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,926
Rosa, we have a lead!
We finally have a lead!

366
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,361
Whatever. I'm not talking to you.

367
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,644
Let's go.

368
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,532
That seems like a good thing.
Why isn't she happier?

369
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,134
There's a lot going on
that I can't explain, Ezra!

370
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,536
But thank you.
Seriously, you saved the day.

371
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:29,545
Look at us.

372
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:30,858
Following an old lady,

373
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:32,645
about to catch our white whale.

374
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:36,018
Ah, just another exciting day
for the sleuth sisters.

375
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:38,091
That's a name I just came up with.

376
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:39,906
If you like it, stay silent.

377
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,491
Good, I like it too.
That's our name forever.

378
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:44,160
Oh, that's weird.

379
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:45,995
The nursing home's calling me. Hello?

380
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,530
<i>Hello, this is Eunice,</i>

381
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,332
the lady from the home
with the chambermaid.

382
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,334
- Yes.
- I mentioned Frank's niece's

383
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:53,936
- botched uterus.
- We know who you are, Eunice.

384
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:56,138
- What can I help you with?
<i>- You said to call you</i>

385
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:58,140
- if I saw anything peculiar.
<i>- Mm-hmm?</i>

386
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:00,309
There's a very strange man
in Louise's room,

387
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:02,144
digging around while she's away.

388
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,247
<i>- Isn't that peculiar?</i>
- Can I put you on hold?

389
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:05,372
<i>Is there music?</i>

390
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:06,975
<i>I love the mu...</i>

391
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:08,244
I bet that's Sergio.

392
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,880
I bet he set up this whole Louise thing

393
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,415
as a distraction to get us
out of the nursing home

394
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:13,117
because that's where he stashed his cash

395
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:14,418
before he went to Paraguay.

396
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:16,287
Damn it, I wish there
was some way to know

397
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:18,394
if that peculiar man was Sergio.

398
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:20,263
Eunice, what did the man smell like?

399
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:21,731
Like an English garden.

400
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:26,602
Okay, I have a plan
to get us back on budget.

401
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:29,138
I got my groom gut to agree
to a more basic wine package.

402
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,744
Basic meaning simple,
or basic meaning "basic"?

403
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,246
Basic meaning "basic," Terry.

404
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,048
We're drinking the wine with
the foot on the label,

405
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:36,651
but it's a huge savings
and we can make up the rest

406
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:38,470
if we just assemble
the gift bags ourselves.

407
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:40,072
Okay, we can do that.

408
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:41,340
How much work can that possibly be?

409
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:43,109
Here are Amy's instructions.

410
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:45,221
"Place eight Jordan almonds...
two pink, two blue,

411
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:46,956
"two white, and two purple...
at the center

412
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,325
"of the organza square.
Draw the corners to a point

413
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,760
"and use the two-centimeter ribbon

414
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:52,762
to cinch into a mini-bag." Good lord.

415
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:55,665
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- That's step one... of 38.

416
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,747
We don't have time for that!
We need help.

417
00:13:57,783 --> 00:13:59,182
- We need to hire a team.
- I know,

418
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:00,885
but there's no money in the budget.

419
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,039
Unless... maybe we could find people

420
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:04,979
that were willing to work
for something other than money.

421
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,743
Hey, Hitchcock and Scully!
How would you two like

422
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,182
to earn some candy almonds?

423
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:12,315
You got our attention.

424
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,616
- Water bottle.
- Nut assortment.

425
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:15,217
- Local jam.
- Jake and Amy cookie.

426
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:17,019
- Cone of pretzels.
- Jordan almonds, and...

427
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:18,254
Aspirin for the morning after.

428
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:20,556
- Cake pops.
- And cinch and...

429
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,024
- Done.
- Blink.

430
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,459
- Mmm.
- Block.

431
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,461
Sir, Olivia Crawford is on her way up.

432
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:26,588
I know. I invited her.

433
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:28,124
Did you change your mind
about the whispering?

434
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,649
'Cause we came up with some dandies.

435
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:31,952
I heard she's a day drinker.

436
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:33,487
I heard she doesn't like me.

437
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,371
I actually did hear that.
Officer Thomas told me.

438
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,106
I told you I wouldn't be doing that.

439
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:38,341
I've come up with a different plan

440
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:39,809
- and I've implemented it.
- Raymond.

441
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:40,855
Hello.

442
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:44,195
- You have goop in your eye.
- No, I don't.

443
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:45,815
I rinsed my eyes before you arrived.

444
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,107
Fine. What's this about?

445
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:49,151
I wanted to let you know
that I've thought it over,

446
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:51,387
and I've been acting selfishly.

447
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,589
I wasn't considering
what's best for this city.

448
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,524
That's why, before you got here,

449
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,426
I sent a letter withdrawing my name

450
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:58,728
- from the commissioners race.
- What?

451
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,363
- No!
- You're young and smart

452
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:01,597
and progressive
and a hell of a lot better

453
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:03,199
than John Kelly. I've been waiting

454
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:04,667
my entire career for
a commissioner like you.

455
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:06,502
- Captain...
- If I have to be

456
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:07,737
the bigger person to open
the doors to change, then...

457
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,338
I also felt bad.

458
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:10,673
And I also sent in a letter

459
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,541
withdrawing my name from contention.

460
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,030
We just made John Kelly commissioner.

461
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:20,032
Not if we get those letters
back before anyone reads them.

462
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:22,718
- Are you too old to run?
- Are you too inexperienced

463
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:25,121
to know that power-walking
is a far more efficient

464
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:26,389
and sustainable method of hurrying?

465
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:27,423
Burn.

466
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:32,461
Wow!

467
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:34,263
We're actually gonna get these gift bags

468
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:36,332
to the venue before they close.
Thank you, Terry.

469
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:37,423
Don't thank me.

470
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:38,933
Hitchcock and Scully
did more than I did.

471
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:40,380
Yeah, but you had to hold
your hand near their mouth

472
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,520
when you fed them those almonds.

473
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,805
And that's scary.
We're like snapping turtles.

474
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,441
Exactly. All right, let's get going.

475
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:46,776
Those chocolates are gonna melt.

476
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:48,377
Oop. Open up.

477
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:49,879
- I gave you the keys.
- Oh, right.

478
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:51,847
Um... oh, no. Where did I put them?

479
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:53,749
Let's see. I had them in my left hand,

480
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,217
and then I went to open the trunk,

481
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:56,685
so I switched to my right hand.

482
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:58,387
Oh, but then I had to sneeze,
and I thought,

483
00:15:58,423 --> 00:15:59,722
"I don't want to sneeze on these keys."

484
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:01,690
Dr. Seuss. Not really, but should be.

485
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:04,827
"Do not sneeze on my keys.
Do not wheeze on my keys.

486
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:08,497
Do not sneeze on your knees
on my keys, if you please."

487
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,332
Jake, could you please move
along on this thought journey?

488
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:11,600
Yeah, right, sorry.
Okay, so then I put them

489
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,940
on top of a plastic tub, which is...

490
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:16,701
locked inside the car.

491
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,608
The keys are locked inside the car!

492
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,438
Why?

493
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,559
- He's gone.
- Look at the vent.

494
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,682
We were right.
He came back for the cash.

495
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,884
Hi, it's Eunice,
the lady with the chambermaid.

496
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,419
Yes, Eunice, we know who you are.

497
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:31,821
That man is in the hall right now.

498
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:33,422
- What?
- Ooh.

499
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,723
He's heading for the back exit!

500
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,076
Look! There's Sergio.

501
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:40,612
Damn it! He's getting away again.

502
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:42,248
Not this time, partner.
See you on the ground.

503
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:45,051
- What?
- You're mine, Sergio!

504
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,586
Ow!

505
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,704
Did he get away?

506
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,475
Yes. Very easily.

507
00:16:56,455 --> 00:16:58,088
What the hell were you thinking?

508
00:16:58,124 --> 00:16:59,874
You're lucky you just
dislocated your knee.

509
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:00,878
How do you know it's dislocated?

510
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:02,272
I went to med school for three years.

511
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:03,648
- You did? When?
- That's not the point!

512
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:04,649
Why did you jump off the building?

513
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:05,917
I was trying to make up

514
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:07,318
for letting him get away
seven years ago.

515
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:08,586
What? I don't care about that.

516
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:10,288
You had an instinct. You followed it

517
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:12,216
and you were wrong.
That happens to everybody.

518
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:13,873
I care that you lied to me.

519
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:14,960
It's just...

520
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:17,777
we didn't know each
other well back then,

521
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:20,814
and, to be honest, when I
first got to the Nine-Nine,

522
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,983
I was a little intimidated by you.

523
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:24,341
Good. Go on.

524
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,952
And then it got more and more
awkward to bring up,

525
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:27,821
so... I never did.

526
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:29,656
I just hoped that we'd
catch him eventually

527
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:33,022
and you'd never be tipped off
to the fact that I let him go.

528
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,999
Oh!

529
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:37,334
What are you doing
with your face and your voice?

530
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,898
I had an epiphany
and I got real excited.

531
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,601
I moved my knee
and now I hurt a-real bad.

532
00:17:41,637 --> 00:17:42,736
Okay, breathe through the pain

533
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,737
and tell me what you figured out.

534
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:44,732
Someone tipped off Sergio

535
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:46,234
that the cops were visiting
his grandmother,

536
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,797
and there was only one person
that knew we were cops.

537
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,609
That nurse who hates old people, Ezra.

538
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:51,401
Of course. Never leave
your money unprotected.

539
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,025
That's the first thing
I learned in business school.

540
00:17:53,061 --> 00:17:54,670
You also went to business school?

541
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,648
Yeah, and I also have
a pilot's license. Whatever.

542
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:58,116
Point is, now we have a link to Sergio,

543
00:17:58,152 --> 00:17:59,751
- so let's go get him.
- So we're good?

544
00:18:00,022 --> 00:18:01,593
You're not mad at me anymore?

545
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,523
No. You're about to be

546
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,758
- real mad at me.
- For what?

547
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:05,892
'Cause I'm gonna reset your knee.

548
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:06,973
- Look at the bunny.
- Huh?

549
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:09,629
I called the locksmith.

550
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:11,665
He said an hour.
That means two hours minimum.

551
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,400
We can't wait that long.
Our little cookie faces

552
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:14,534
are already melting.

553
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,729
We look like a couple of Slimers.

554
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:17,698
Yeah, those cookies
are definitely ruined.

555
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:20,602
- I'll take them off your hands.
- You're a good person, Scully.

556
00:18:20,638 --> 00:18:21,904
This is crazy.

557
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,573
Why don't you have a backup key, Terry?

558
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:25,912
The dealer tried charging me
an extra $300 for it.

559
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:27,347
I told him I didn't want it

560
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:29,783
because Terry never loses his key.

561
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,818
Yeah, but Jake does.
You always have to plan

562
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,653
around me. I'm a part of your life.

563
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:34,988
All right, look.
We only have one option left.

564
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:36,942
You're gonna have to pick up the car
and carry it to the venue.

565
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:38,244
Well, how will we get the bags out?

566
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,846
Is that seriously your only problem

567
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:41,248
- with what I just said?
- Pretty much.

568
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:43,462
This was a test. These tasks were a way

569
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,731
for me to prove I was gonna
be a good husband,

570
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:46,129
- and I failed!
- Jake,

571
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:49,033
being a good husband doesn't
mean you have to pass some test

572
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:51,604
or do everything right.
Do you have any idea

573
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,106
how often I mess things up?

574
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:54,497
- So you're a bad husband too?
- No.

575
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,166
Definitely not.
You're cutting in too soon

576
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,417
- before the point.
- Sorry.

577
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:00,580
Look, being a good husband
is about caring enough to try.

578
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:01,982
This whole day, you've been doing

579
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,384
everything possible to
make sure Amy was happy.

580
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:06,086
You keep doing that, you gonna be okay,

581
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:07,990
even if you make some mistakes.

582
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:09,315
You're right.

583
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:11,758
Thanks, Terry.

584
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:13,693
Hiyah!

585
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:15,729
What the hell? My van!

586
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:18,043
- What are you doing?
- Whatever it takes to make Amy happy.

587
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,176
You told me to do this.
Now, let's get these gift bags

588
00:19:20,212 --> 00:19:21,548
to the venue!

589
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,537
Oh, my God! Why did you do that?

590
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:26,773
Because I care! Oh, I feel so good.

591
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:28,441
Why'd you break a second window, fool?

592
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:30,810
You know, you're really stepping
on my moment here, Terry.

593
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:32,112
I love Amy Santiago!

594
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:34,268
We're gonna take each other's names!

595
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:35,336
Let's go!

596
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:36,687
_

597
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:44,124
- Boyle, watch the door.
- Watch the door.

598
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:47,060
That's the job they always give
the coolest guy in the heist.

599
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:49,029
Everyone else, dig in.
We're looking for any letter

600
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,815
addressed to Deputy
Commissioner Stevenson.

601
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,183
Are we even sure they're here?

602
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:54,033
I messengered mine over.
There are only three

603
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,412
building-wide distributions a day.

604
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:56,614
The next one isn't until 6:00 p.m.,

605
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,883
so we still have 22 minutes.

606
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,407
What are we looking for?
Can you describe the envelope?

607
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:02,108
It was a white number ten.
It's the same kind you use

608
00:20:02,144 --> 00:20:03,567
to send fan mail to yourself.

609
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,970
I've never done that,
but I do know what envelopes

610
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,770
my fans use, so that's very helpful.

611
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:10,367
Is this it?

612
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:12,719
Yes! Well done, Olivia.

613
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,054
Okay, tear that up,

614
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,022
and now we just have
to find your letter.

615
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:17,957
What are the dimensions
of your envelope?

616
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:19,159
Zero by zero.

617
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,862
It's too late for me.

618
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:24,130
I withdrew from the race by e-mail.

619
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,799
- What?
- Yes, I used e-mail,

620
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,967
because I'm not a million years old.

621
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:30,003
Listen, the only reason why
I even made it this far

622
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:32,639
is because you stood up for me
with the selection committee.

623
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,674
I came here to make sure
that at least one of us

624
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,711
stays in the running.
Someone has to beat John Kelly.

625
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:39,665
So you better get that damn job.

626
00:20:40,464 --> 00:20:42,585
'Cause I'm excited to have you
as my commissioner.

627
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:45,844
Thank you, Olivia.

628
00:20:46,422 --> 00:20:48,389
And I'll be excited for you
to be commissioner after me.

629
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:49,889
That'll probably be
in a matter of months,

630
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:52,041
once you die from old age.

631
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,385
Go get 'em, Grandpa.

632
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:58,459
Nurse Ezra, hey. Do you have a minute?

633
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,328
I'm actually kind of busy right now.

634
00:21:00,364 --> 00:21:02,998
Right, harboring a fugitive.
Should I come back, or...

635
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:04,700
he's here and on the move!

636
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,490
All right, Sergio.

637
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:17,183
We've been waiting seven
years to say this.

638
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:19,219
Sergio Mindar, you're under arrest.

639
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:22,789
That's Y-O-U, apostrophe, R-E.

640
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,026
I can't believe you caught me.

641
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:26,396
Well, believe it. We're an amazing team.

642
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:29,362
- We're the sleuth sisters.
- Damn straight, we are.

643
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:36,136
- Lame.
- Stay out of it, Sergio!

644
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:42,188

1
00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:03,139
So, I got assigned to this one rookie,

2
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:04,743
and on his training day,

3
00:00:04,777 --> 00:00:07,780
I made him smoke angel dust at gunpoint.

4
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:10,851
King Kong ain't got nothing on me.

5
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:12,821
Isn't that the plot and tagline of...

6
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:14,590
The movie "Training Day"?
Yes, great observation, Tank.

7
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:15,826
That's because it's based on my life.

8
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:19,132
Lunch is over. Bus your trays.

9
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,934
- Now, Peralta.
- I haven't finished

10
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:23,741
- my lemon cookie, bull.
- And you're not gonna get to,

11
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:24,942
either. Give it to me.

12
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:26,646
Oh, you want the cookie?

13
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:30,853
- Oh!
- There's your cookie.

14
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:32,923
- You're going in the hole.
- Oh, I'm going in the hole?

15
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:34,759
- Yeah.
- Yeah, bring it on!

16
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:36,461
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

17
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:37,866
Remember what you saw here today!

18
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,701
You can lock me up,

19
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:41,504
but one day I'll get out of here,

20
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,609
and I'll come for you!
I'll come for all of you!

21
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:44,777
Hey, Warden. What's up?

22
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,513
Next time, don't wait so long

23
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:47,949
to spit the cookie. I've been waiting

24
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:49,751
in here for four
minutes, and it's gross.

25
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,555
- Yeah, it really is.
- Okay, snitch time.

26
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:53,491
- What's up with Romero?
- All right, he's got

27
00:00:53,527 --> 00:00:55,430
a "delivery" coming in
on Wednesday night.

28
00:00:55,463 --> 00:00:57,634
One of the cafeteria workers
is smuggling something in

29
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,771
- with the produce.
- Great.

30
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:01,908
- See you Thursday.
- Wait, what?

31
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:03,877
You're just gonna leave
me in here, in solitary?

32
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:06,649
You spit in a guard's face.
That's five days in the hole.

33
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:08,486
Yeah, but, I mean, you made me do that.

34
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,589
Well, we don't want anybody
getting suspicious, huh?

35
00:01:10,624 --> 00:01:13,963
Have fun.

36
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:15,565
Try not to go crazy.

37
00:01:19,874 --> 00:01:22,811
Okay. No big deal.

38
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:24,849
Five days is nothing. I'm
not afraid to be alone

39
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:26,818
with my thoughts. My
thoughts are awesome.

40
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,821
"Die Hard 6" on a cruise ship,
pizza bagel restaurant,

41
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,925
my father never loved me, I'm
gonna die alone... oh, boy,

42
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,894
that happened fast. Guard? Guard!

43
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:56,070
A 300 call number in
the fine arts section?

44
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:57,840
What is this, Beirut?

45
00:01:57,874 --> 00:02:00,077
You know, you don't work here.

46
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,913
You don't have to reshelve the books.

47
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:03,883
Well, someone has to.

48
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:06,088
I'm so sorry. I'm just
really stressed out.

49
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:08,859
You're a great librarian, and
I'm sure you're not the one

50
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:10,696
- who shelved this section.
- I am.

51
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,935
God, Debbie, what is going on with you?

52
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:23,184
Debbie? Is that you?

53
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,690
Are you mad? Because I think

54
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:26,857
I've been more than fair.

55
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,693
Hello, Detective Santiago.

56
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:30,798
Ah, no need for the gun.
I'm not here to hurt you.

57
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,668
My name is Seamus Murphy.

58
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:35,639
Yeah, I know who you are.
Every cop in the city does.

59
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:37,042
- What do you want, Seamus?
- To help.

60
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:39,045
I know your boyfriend got framed.

61
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,681
Maybe I could give you
the proof you need

62
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:42,117
to take down the cop that set him up.

63
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:43,920
You have something on Hawkins?

64
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,625
She's about to move
5-million dollars' worth

65
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:47,662
of stolen diamonds...
stones that tie her

66
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:49,698
to the robberies. I could tell you

67
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:51,969
- how to find them.
- Why would you do that?

68
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:54,740
'Cause I wanna be friends.
I do you a favor,

69
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,047
and one day, you do me a favor.

70
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,083
I don't know. Think about it.

71
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:03,223
But don't think too hard, huh?

72
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:05,893
You only got three days.

73
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:12,071
Forgive me, books.

74
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:13,739
Oh, God.

75
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,244
So, how was your first
stint in solitary?

76
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:17,247
It was nothing.
I held it together.

77
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,851
Oh... Amy.

78
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:21,286
When'd you get here?

79
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:25,761
You've come for my
conjugal capabilities.

80
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:28,032
You're looking real good, girl.

81
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,002
Whoa, lost a booby.

82
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:33,108
No matter. I'll just build another one.

83
00:03:33,142 --> 00:03:36,481
More mashed potatoes!

84
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:39,151
So, what happened with that
sweet intel I gave you?

85
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,858
Your tip was garbage. We
busted Romero's delivery.

86
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:45,163
Get this... nothing but toothbrushes,

87
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:48,803
- shampoo, and soap.
- Ooh, lemon verbena.

88
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:50,338
- Can I keep this?
- Yes, you should... you reek.

89
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:52,241
'Cause you put me in the hole.

90
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,910
- Have you ever heard of Blizz?
- Yeah, the drug, right?

91
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:55,346
Uh-huh. And thanks to your pal Romero,

92
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:57,953
it's taking over the prison.
I need you to find out

93
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,957
- where he keeps his stash.
- Well,

94
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,126
I doubt he would tell me that.
I'm not exactly

95
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:04,062
- in the inner circle.
- Maybe you just need

96
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:06,833
some extra incentive. Find the stash,

97
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:08,370
or I'll tell everybody you're a snitch.

98
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:10,341
What? No. They'll kill me.

99
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,345
You don't want that, right?
It'd probably be a lot of

100
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,114
- paperwork for you.
- Oh, it's not.

101
00:04:14,148 --> 00:04:17,085
It's just one form, and
it's already filled out.

102
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:21,025
We just have to staple a
picture of your corpse to it.

103
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:24,264
Great. Prison... is great.

104
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:27,905
He said I have three days to decide.

105
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,841
We should tread lightly.
Seamus Murphy is the head

106
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:31,344
of the most brutal crime
family in New York.

107
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:33,348
This is bad. This is really, really bad.

108
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:35,150
Are you concerned about Seamus Murphy,

109
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:36,821
Detective Scully, or
were you having trouble

110
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:38,890
- with the jumble?
- Oh... the first one.

111
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:40,427
Murphy didn't ask me to
do anything illegal.

112
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,162
He just wants me to owe him a favor.

113
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,900
Right, but we don't want to be indebted

114
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,236
- to a man like this.
- I understand,

115
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,039
but we've been watching
Hawkins for a month,

116
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:49,243
and we have nothing to connect
her to the robberies.

117
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:51,914
Maybe we should pursue other routes.

118
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:54,919
Um, some of us are already
pursuing other routes, Amy.

119
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:57,424
This is Charles Boyle,
and you're listening to

120
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:01,263
A God in Shackles."

121
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:05,170
this podcast is
brought to you by Fun Frames...

122
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,308
make your spectacles a spectacle.

123
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:09,044
And how is your podcast supposed to

124
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:10,080
get Jake out of prison?

125
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:11,282
I lay out the facts,

126
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:13,085
people see he was framed.

127
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:15,422
I build an audience. I get
a celebrity listener.

128
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:17,994
It's Debra Messing. She tweets a link.

129
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,097
- Now Sean Hayes is involved.
- Boyle, that's enough.

130
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:22,234
I know dealing with a
criminal is bad news,

131
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:24,972
but I can't just let Jake sit in prison.

132
00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:26,407
Okay, maybe we can figure
out what Murphy knows

133
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:29,514
without taking his deal.
He says that Hawkins is

134
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:31,149
moving the diamonds in three days.

135
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:33,020
That's a new lead. Let's work it

136
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,956
instead of putting your
career in jeopardy.

137
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:37,228
- Okay, let's give it a shot.
- Whoo-hoo!

138
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:39,298
That was also not about the jumble.

139
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:41,266
We're all excited about the same thing.

140
00:05:43,237 --> 00:05:44,205
Did you miss me?

141
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,275
Oh, my God!

142
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:47,044
It's Jake! Don't kill me!

143
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:48,112
- I was just doing Batman!
- What's wrong with you?

144
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,549
Never sneak up on me.

145
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,952
- I was sharpening my shiv.
- Right, I'm sorry.

146
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:52,087
It's prison. I forgot.

147
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,489
What's up? I'm busy, bitch.

148
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:56,261
Well, all that time in the hole kind of

149
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:59,267
I'm clearly
gonna be here for a while.

150
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:02,172
I wanna live my best
prison life, and for me,

151
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:03,975
that means doing more for the gang.

152
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:05,477
Now I was thinking,
specifically, I'd be great

153
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,280
in and around the world of drugs,

154
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:09,552
because, let's be honest:
I'm not great at murder.

155
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:11,455
- What do you think?
- Nah, that's okay.

156
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:13,491
- I don't need any help.
- Totally, totally.

157
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:16,129
You're great at what you do.
You don't need me.

158
00:06:16,164 --> 00:06:19,202
But, maybe... I could learn from you.

159
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:21,171
You know? Sort of shadow you for a while

160
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:22,374
and see how your operation runs.

161
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:25,346
Go from bitch to boss, as it were.

162
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,281
Jake, you stop pushing it.

163
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:30,121
You're gonna make me
think you're a snitch.

164
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:31,523
And you know what I do to snitches?

165
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,192
Give them a public dressing down?

166
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,362
Castrate them.

167
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,566
And then I kick 'em to death.

168
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,308
Cool... cool, specific policy.
Love the attitude, love you,

169
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,244
love all of this... okay, see you

170
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,380
in the mess hall, Romero. Bye, Romero.

171
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,714
Hey, I'm in a bind. I need your help.

172
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:49,518
- That's what friends are for.
- Well, "friends" might be

173
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,886
a bit of a stretch. I
mean, you're a cannibal

174
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,987
- that ate six people.
- 9 1/2.

175
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:54,715
Yup, worse. All right,
here are my options:

176
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,734
A, I keep pestering Romero to
tell me where the drugs are,

177
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,570
he realizes I'm a snitch,
then he castrates me

178
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:00,306
- and kicks me to death.
- That's not great.

179
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,344
- What's option B?
- I back off Romero, never find

180
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:03,879
out where the drugs are,
the warden tells everyone

181
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:05,918
I'm a snitch, and then
Romero castrates me

182
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,654
- and kicks me to death.
- Mm, both options sound...

183
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,660
A little castrate-y?
Yeah, that's what I keep

184
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,594
- bumping up against too.
- Well, you know, whenever

185
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,867
I'm backed into a corner,
I just do what I do best:

186
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,371
I drive across country,
forge a new identity,

187
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,905
and then take a job as a camp counselor.

188
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,678
Oh, my God. Caleb, you're a genius.

189
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,047
I wouldn't say genius. That camp ran

190
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:24,984
a pretty extensive background check.

191
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:26,887
No, not that... your past
is a straight-up nightmare,

192
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:28,958
but I need to do "what I do best":

193
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,962
be a cop, work the case,

194
00:07:30,996 --> 00:07:32,798
figure out where the
drugs are on my own.

195
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:34,601
And you tell the warden,
and the warden will

196
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:36,404
- bust Romero.
- And Romero won't think

197
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:37,773
I'm a snitch, because he never
told me where they are.

198
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,343
All right, this is gonna be tough.

199
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,944
I'm really gonna have
to thread the needle.

200
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,848
Ooh! I got really good
at threading needles.

201
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:44,719
Back when you were making
your skin suit, I know.

202
00:07:44,753 --> 00:07:46,354
Look, I like being friends
with you, but you have to

203
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,358
- stop bringing that up.
- But we're friends?

204
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,996
<i>Moving $5 million in diamonds</i>

205
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:51,698
is not an everyday activity,

206
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,634
so Hawkins must be
altering her behavior.

207
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,337
She's not. I've been
tailing her for days.

208
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:57,041
Scully and I went out
to Flaxton Hill Farms

209
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,743
to watch the guy who
testified for Hawkins.

210
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,780
All he does is feed his pigs.

211
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,351
They eat seven or eight meals a day...

212
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:04,788
sometimes by force.
They're living the dream.

213
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:06,024
You know they get slaughtered.

214
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:07,927
- Worth it.
- Hey, I think

215
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,830
I found something interesting.
I was double-checking

216
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,099
last month's surveillance photos,

217
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:12,768
and I noticed this.

218
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:14,372
Hawkins has two different phones:

219
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:16,073
her normal cell, and then this one

220
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:18,811
that only has one app on the
home screen... Snapchat.

221
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:22,085
Oh, she's up to something.
Snapchat messages disappear.

222
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:24,422
You can send anything to anybody,

223
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:27,027
and after they see it,
it's like I never sent it.

224
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:29,065
Nobody ask Hitchcock why he knows that.

225
00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:30,832
Could we put a mirroring
app on her phone

226
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:32,469
so we could watch everything she does?

227
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:34,974
Oh, those work great, but
you have to physically

228
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,743
have her phone to install it.

229
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,147
Nobody ask Hitchcock why he knows that.

230
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:39,883
I know how we can get Hawkins' phone.

231
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:41,452
We get her to visit prison.

232
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,055
They make you leave
your phone in your car.

233
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,925
I wanted to record Jake for the podcast,

234
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,829
but they said I couldn't.
I had to have Terry on

235
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:48,732
- as a guest.
- I gave up my Saturday

236
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,102
for that. You said I did great.

237
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:51,438
I'm the host. I have to say that.

238
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:52,872
So, all we need to do is get

239
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,810
Hawkins to visit someone in prison.

240
00:08:54,844 --> 00:08:57,181
No, absolutely not. What
would I even say to her?

241
00:08:57,215 --> 00:08:58,849
Well, perhaps you could
ask her to put in

242
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:00,753
a good word for you with the warden,

243
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:02,089
- so you can get extra yard time.
- So, you want me to beg

244
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:04,127
the woman I hate for mercy. Cool.

245
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,130
Oh, one problem. How do I stop myself

246
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:07,898
from smashing through
the glass and squeezing

247
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:09,835
the life out of her with my bare hands?

248
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,906
Maybe you could just imagine doing that.

249
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,109
It'd be probably just as fun
as actually doing it, right?

250
00:09:14,143 --> 00:09:15,779
- No.
- I'm with Diaz.

251
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,483
Imagination is never the solution.

252
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:19,888
We just need three minutes
to get inside her car

253
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:22,024
and install the app.

254
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:24,528
Okay. I can grovel for three minutes.

255
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:26,565
- But one second more...
- Yes, yes, we know.

256
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,503
You burst through the glass and
squeeze the life out of her

257
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:31,809
with your bare hands. Well...
I think we have a plan.

258
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:37,151
Don't let them see us. Blend in.

259
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:40,056
I gotta tell you, cop work
is a lot like cannibal work.

260
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,591
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

261
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,528
The watching...

262
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,500
the following...

263
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:49,039
The waiting for soccer practice to end.

264
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:50,541
Come on, man.

265
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:54,849
Did you see that? Romero just went

266
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:56,218
into the showers for
the second time today.

267
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:57,987
Well, maybe he just likes to relax.

268
00:09:58,022 --> 00:09:59,291
No one is relaxed in a prison shower.

269
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:00,926
It's literally the most tense situation

270
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,028
I've ever been in.

271
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:03,931
What's he doing in there?

272
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:05,700
That must be where he stashes the Blizz.

273
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,872
Unless he's just having sex...
no, but he's a huge homophobe.

274
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,141
It's where he stashes the Blizz.

275
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,010
But... all homophobes are secretly gay.

276
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:12,080
You know what? It doesn't matter.

277
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:13,081
We'll check it out later,

278
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:14,584
when he's done.

279
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:16,119
Hawkins must be through security by now.

280
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:17,590
Rosa promised us three minutes, tops.

281
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,191
We'll get the phone. Captain Holt,

282
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:20,327
can you distract the lot attendant?

283
00:10:20,362 --> 00:10:21,363
I'm not Captain Holt.

284
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:23,099
I'm Joe Wozniak,

285
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,602
here to see my girl in prison.

286
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:29,041
And, to help me pass as a straight...

287
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:32,014
Kevin's rose-shearing hat.

288
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:38,325
Little Rosa Diaz.

289
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:41,063
So, I hear you want me to
put in a good word for you

290
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,967
with the warden?

291
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,769
Yes.

292
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:46,040
"Yes," what?

293
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:50,647
Yes... please.

294
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:52,951
I love this. This is so much fun for me.

295
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,787
- Can I help you?
- I'm just trying

296
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,324
to work up the nerve to see her.

297
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:59,195
- See who?
- My female wife, Crystal.

298
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:01,700
I was cheating on her with
a waitress from Wing Sluts

299
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:03,805
named Jamie-Lynn. One night,

300
00:11:03,838 --> 00:11:07,377
when I was... philandering,
Crystal caught me

301
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:10,382
kissing Jamie-Lynn's... heavy breasts.

302
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,354
She flew into a rage,
and now she's serving

303
00:11:13,388 --> 00:11:15,291
five years for aggravated assault.

304
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,461
- Hey, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

305
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:19,064
Hey. Bring it in?

306
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:22,804
Oh...

307
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,373
That's the signal. Go!

308
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,782
Oh, the phone!

309
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:35,127
- Pretty please?
- More.

310
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,465
- With sugar on top?
- More.

311
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:40,503
You should've seen Jamie-Lynn.

312
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:42,138
She looked exactly like

313
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:45,277
"Maxim" Hot 100 honoree Jasmine Sanders.

314
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:47,180

315
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:48,816
It just seems like you
wanna be with Jamie-Lynn.

316
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,486
I mean, you keep talking
about her thigh gap.

317
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:52,156
That's my favorite part of a woman.

318
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,228
There's nothing more intoxicating

319
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:56,531
than the clear absence of a penis.

320
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,902
But, you're right. I need
to forget about Crystal.

321
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,370
Thanks for the advice.

322
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:03,376
I'm off to... plow my mistress.

323
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,781
More.

324
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:07,215
Time's up.

325
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:20,473
Diaz.

326
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,944
Hello? Diaz!

327
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:26,517
You don't even beg well.
Have fun rotting in prison.

328
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:27,953
Okay.

329
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:29,489
Thanks for coming in.

330
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,195
So, you really think this is where

331
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:34,897
Romero's stashing the drugs?

332
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:36,600
I mean, it's a good idea.
There's no cameras in here.

333
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,606
- What does Blizz look like?
- Like little white candies.

334
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:40,340
Oh, I love candies... many
say, to the point that

335
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,910
it'll eventually kill me.

336
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:44,382
Hey, I found something.

337
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,386
Oh, twinsies.

338
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:48,922
What is this? A melon baller?

339
00:12:48,956 --> 00:12:50,359
Wait a minute.

340
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:52,295
Romero doesn't stash the drugs in here.

341
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,367
He comes in here to
make the Blizz balls.

342
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,335
So, he brings a brick of
drugs into the shower

343
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,540
- without getting noticed?
- Yeah...

344
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:00,310
Oh, my God.

345
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:01,979
He smuggles the Blizz
into the prison in...

346
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:03,349
- The soap dish.
- No, in the soap.

347
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,618
- It's in the soap.
- Oh, yeah!

348
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:06,020
That's much better. I get it.

349
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:08,424
I did it! I cracked the case!

350
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,194
Hey, you don't think you can get high

351
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:11,430
from rubbing drugs on, like,
your eyes and armpits

352
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:12,900
and up under your b-parts, can you?

353
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:13,935
Whoop, you definitely can.
Here it comes.

354
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:15,003
Whoa-oh-oh, Caleb!

355
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:17,288
And you know what else I think...
are you listening?

356
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:19,238
Huh? Are you, Mr. Warden?
I think we should be able

357
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:20,775
to decorate our own cells, don't you?
I mean, choose

358
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,579
our own wallpaper, laminated flooring,

359
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:24,147
crown molding... my friend
Charles loves crown molding.

360
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:25,751
He says if it doesn't have the crown,

361
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:27,654
- you have to vote it down.
- Are you on drugs?

362
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,590
Yes, and you should too, you know?
Get on my level.

363
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,458
Because quite frankly, we're
not on the same wavelength,

364
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,329
At agg... at agg, at agg.

365
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:35,034
That's weird, I can't say
the word "agg" anymore.

366
00:13:35,036 --> 00:13:36,470
Yup, you've done a ton of Blizz.

367
00:13:36,512 --> 00:13:37,947
Yes, Blizz! That's why I'm here.

368
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:39,932
Wait, why am I here?

369
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:41,770
- Blizz.
- Yes! Romero is smuggling

370
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:43,407
the Blizz into the
prison as bars of soap.

371
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:45,344
Interesting. Hey, that's good work.

372
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,349
I know! I am the smartest man

373
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:49,818
of agg time! "Agg time."

374
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:51,020
Agg time!

375
00:13:51,054 --> 00:13:53,058
Agg time! That was it.

376
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:58,534
Oh, man, I have a lot of energy.

377
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:00,539
Wait, no... I'm exhausted.

378
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:01,907
I wonder if I can touch the ceiling.

379
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:07,082
Peralta.

380
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:08,318
Rombargo.

381
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:12,493
Where were you with that guard?

382
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:14,395
Great question.

383
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:16,467
When is Hawkins
gonna unlock her phone?

384
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:18,336
We've been staring at her stupid face

385
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,374
- for 14 hours.
- I don't mind.

386
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:21,909
This is a dead end. Maybe I should call

387
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:23,478
Seamus Murphy before it's too late.

388
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:25,114
I thought we agreed that's a bad idea.

389
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:26,450
What other options do we have?

390
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:27,919
There is still the podcast.

391
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:29,488
Guys, she unlocked the phone.

392
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:30,926
She's in the app and she's typing.

393
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,496
"Diamond emoji in locker 805.

394
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,568
Bus station, Linden, NJ. Pickup 5:15."

395
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:38,070
We have one hour. Let's move.

396
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:39,841
Answer the question.

397
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,510
Why were you coming
out of the admin wing

398
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:44,082
- with a guard?
- Um...

399
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,617
<i>Okay, Jake! Don't freak out.</i>

400
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,386
<i>Just stay calm. You're on a crazy amount</i>

401
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,056
<i>of Blizz, but your brain still works.</i>

402
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:50,961
The warden was yelling at me.

403
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:52,630
- Are you on Blizz?
- What?

404
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:55,034
What makes you think that?

405
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,069
'Cause you just told us.

406
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,472
Okay, Jake.

407
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:58,940
Don't freak out. Just stay calm.

408
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,110
You're on a crazy amount of Blizz,

409
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:01,446
but your brain still works.

410
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,153
Yep, I am nips-deep in Blizz.

411
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:11,096
Nice.

412
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,000
I was worried you were still a cop,

413
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:15,169
but what kind of cop does
that much meth?

414
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:17,474
Well, no, no, not meth. Blizz.

415
00:15:17,507 --> 00:15:19,142
Yeah, that's meth. We just call it Blizz

416
00:15:19,178 --> 00:15:20,513
'cause meth has a bit
of an image problem.

417
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:21,682
Oh! Oh, my God,

418
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:23,018
I guess I'm addicted to meth.

419
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,687
No, I'm not. I just love it

420
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,688
and I am consumed with the thought

421
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:27,157
of doing it again.

422
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,196
So, now I know I can trust you, huh?

423
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,166
I can tell you how I
smuggle in the Blizz.

424
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:34,037
Oh, no, no, no. You don't
have to tell me that.

425
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:35,572
- I don't even wanna know.
- As bars of soap.

426
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:37,075
Oh.

427
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,248
- Smart.
- Congratulations.

428
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:42,116
You're one of only two people who know.

429
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,722
Ah... that's great.

430
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:46,223
Glad to be part of such an elite group.

431
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:47,628
You know what?

432
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:49,196
I think my Blizz is wearing off.

433
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:50,700
- I should probably go lie down.
- Yeah.

434
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:53,070
The diarrhea's coming.
That is very common.

435
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:54,306
Don't let the volume scare you.

436
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,575
Wait.

437
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:57,210
Volume as in noise or amount?

438
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:59,749
Oh, God, it's both, isn't it?

439
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,753
Okay, I've got eyes on locker 805.

440
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:03,221
I'm within sight of both exits.

441
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,125
Copy that. It's almost five.

442
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:07,663
<i>- Where's Boyle?</i>
- Shalom, Amy.

443
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:09,231
Charles, what are you doing?

444
00:16:09,265 --> 00:16:11,236
Taking this undercover
mission seriously.

445
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,741
- Seems like I'm the only one.
- It's a bus station.

446
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:16,011
We don't need disguises.
Anyone can be here.

447
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:17,212
Typical shiksa.

448
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:18,714
I see movement at the locker.

449
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,552
<i>He's opening 805! Let's go!</i>

450
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:21,755
NYPD! Get down!

451
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:23,256
- Down!
- Drop your bag.

452
00:16:27,698 --> 00:16:30,568
No diamonds, just... this.

453
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,810
- Hello?<i>
- It's Hawkins.</i>

454
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:37,682
When will you learn that
you will never beat me?

455
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:39,419
You're not gonna get away with this.

456
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:41,221
- We're gonna take you down.<i>
- It's over, Holt.</i>

457
00:16:41,255 --> 00:16:44,361
Checkmate. Knight's
bishop to queen five.

458
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:45,797
<i>Buh-bye now.</i>

459
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,801
She set us up.

460
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:49,804
Oy vey.

461
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:52,581
- What do you want, Peralta?
- Stop everything.

462
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,480
Romero told me that the
Blizz is in the soap.

463
00:16:54,574 --> 00:16:56,136
If you take away his supply,
he'll know I'm the snitch

464
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:57,477
- and kill me.
- Nah, sorry.

465
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:58,545
I already made the report to my bosses,

466
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:00,280
and they were very pleased.

467
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:04,159
Glen couldn't stop smiling. Glen?

468
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:05,216
You don't know what a big deal that is.

469
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:06,851
Anyway, you're too late.

470
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:08,488
We're confiscating all of Romero's soap

471
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,057
- as we speak.
- Okay, how about this?

472
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:11,526
Throw me in solitary. Right?

473
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:12,929
That way, Romero can't get to me.

474
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:14,098
No, Glen's already coming down on me

475
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:15,868
about giving too much solitary.

476
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,703
And I don't wanna piss off Glen.

477
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,206
- Obviously.
- What if I spit on you?

478
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:20,743
You're the warden, right?
That's gotta be

479
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:21,845
at least a month in the hole.

480
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:25,083
Oh, man, my mouth is all dried out

481
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:26,821
from doing the meth. That's
why you don't do meth.

482
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:30,894
Ah, oh, no, no!
Don't tase me, man!

483
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:32,966
Remember that? So funny... but don't.

484
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:34,733
I don't understand.

485
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:36,872
How did she know we were
mirroring her phone?

486
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:38,841
We had one chance, and we blew it!

487
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:40,745
I know you're upset,
but it's really hard

488
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:42,014
to take you seriously when
you still look like that.

489
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:43,749
I used Broadway-caliber spirit gum.

490
00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:45,085
This baby is fused to my cheeks.

491
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,254
Squad, I think I'm onto something.

492
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:47,557
I was listening to an episode

493
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:48,958
of Boyle's podcast.

494
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:49,961
Not the one Terry was on, I hope.

495
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:51,062
No, of course not.

496
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:52,599
That one was problematic.

497
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:54,168
What did I do that was so wrong?

498
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:55,871
It was the episode about
Flaxton Hill Farms.

499
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,008
The part where Scully said

500
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,543
the pigs were being force-fed.

501
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,881
These pigs weigh more than 200 pounds,

502
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:02,783
which means they're finishing pigs.

503
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:05,088
And why would a farmer
force-feed a finishing pig?

504
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:06,623
I don't know what finishing pigs are.

505
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:07,927
- Me neither.
- I'm totally lost.

506
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,028
Because he was feeding them

507
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,031
something other than food!

508
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:11,265
The diamonds!

509
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,902
She's moving them inside the pigs!

510
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:14,906
Let's move.

511
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:16,307
- I still don't get it.
- Nobody does.

512
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:17,810
They're just pretending.

513
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:19,012
I can't believe this.

514
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,315
I'm gonna die in here, and then

515
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,985
you're gonna eat my castrated body.

516
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,188
I guess, but it'd be
a pretty boring meal

517
00:18:24,223 --> 00:18:26,927
- without dessert.
- Oh, my God.

518
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,930
Oh, no. Romero's headed towards us.

519
00:18:28,964 --> 00:18:30,633
- And he looks angry.
- Well, he always looks angry.

520
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,135
Maybe it's not directed at you.

521
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:34,072
No, now he's pointing at you.

522
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:36,144
- This is bad.
- Yeah, I know it's bad.

523
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:40,216
The warden took my entire stash of soap.

524
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:42,254
Apparently, someone
told him it was Blizz.

525
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:44,357
And you want me to help you
figure out who it was.

526
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,259
- Well, it was Tank.
- No, it wasn't.

527
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:47,964
Yeah, it wasn't Tank. It was me.

528
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:49,232
Tank, I came clean and saved your life.

529
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,236
- Now you owe me.
- No I don't.

530
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,072
I told you what I do to snitches.

531
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:54,376
- Hold it, Romero.
- Caleb, what are you doing?

532
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:56,012
It's okay, Jake. I got this.

533
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:58,081
Peralta is my best friend.

534
00:18:58,116 --> 00:18:59,418
If you wanna kill him,
you're gonna have to

535
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,956
kill me first, because friendship...

536
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,326
Oh, my God,
he stabbed me, Jake!

537
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,927
Everybody, get on the ground!

538
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:07,165
- Now!
- You're next, Peralta.

539
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:09,034
You better sleep with one eye open.

540
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:10,270
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

541
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:12,940
He poked me in my tummy.

542
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:15,346
Are you sure? I need you to be sure.

543
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:16,947
You were right.

544
00:19:16,982 --> 00:19:18,283
Pigs' stomachs were full of diamonds.

545
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:19,987
That's it.

546
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:21,456
Everyone on the ground!

547
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,293
- Put down your weapons!
- You're being recorded

548
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:25,364
for a podcast! You will
sign a consent form.

549
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,368
- What's going on here?
- We found the diamonds

550
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,436
and Langdon confessed.

551
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:30,037
It's over, Hawkins.

552
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:31,373
Pawn to king square five,

553
00:19:31,408 --> 00:19:33,142
king's knight to the third square

554
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:36,216
on the bishop's file, queen takes on F7!

555
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:39,353
Checkmate! Now, that's a chess move.

556
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:40,490
Buh-bye now.

557
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:44,798
Peralta.

558
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:46,200
Warden.

559
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:49,406
Your squad busted Melanie Hawkins.

560
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,074
What?

561
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:53,112
You're getting out. Come with me.

562
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:54,782
Okay.

563
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:58,322
Wait. Can I do one thing first?

564
00:19:58,356 --> 00:19:59,791
I wanted to say good-bye.

565
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,293
I can't believe you saved my life.

566
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:03,096
I would not do it again.

567
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,400
- It really hurt.
- Yeah... but you did do it.

568
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:06,802
And I regret it so much.

569
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:08,405
Caleb, you're ruining this.

570
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:10,109
Look, I just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

571
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,312
You got me through this.
I'm gonna miss you.

572
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:13,382
Aww.

573
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,185
Put her there, pal.

574
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:18,289
Guards, guards!

575
00:20:18,323 --> 00:20:19,525
Ladies and gentlemen, please give

576
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,162
a warm Nine-Nine welcome

577
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:23,130
to Jake Peralta and Rosa Diaz!

578
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:27,173
- Ah, it's so good to be back.
- Amen, brother.

579
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:28,475
Can I buy a free man a drink?

580
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:30,243
I'd rather have a drink of that mouth.

581
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:31,813
- Ugh.
- I'm sorry, I just...

582
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:36,322
- I love you.
- I love you too.

583
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:38,158
Hello, I'm also back.

584
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:39,562
- Hey, Rosa.
- So, I heard you spent

585
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:41,263
some time in solitary.
Pretty dope, right?

586
00:20:41,297 --> 00:20:42,833
Uh...

587
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,469
Scar, Sarabi
and I didn't see you

588
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:46,272
at the presentation of Simba.

589
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:49,211
Oh, Mufasa, did I miss it?

590
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:52,316
That's simply... awful.

591
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,119
I handled it well.

592
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:56,090
Sir, I can't believe
your obscure knowledge

593
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,327
of pig-feeding charts saved us.
How did you even think of that?

594
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:00,564
Frankly, I'm embarrassed
it took so long.

595
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:03,905
I should've realized the
second I saw those hogs.

596
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,241
Excuse me.

597
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,581
- Hello?
- So, Captain Holt,

598
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:12,888
did my information prove useful?

599
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,622
Were the diamonds in the pigs?

600
00:21:14,658 --> 00:21:16,360
- Yes, you were right.<i>
- Good.</i>

601
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:17,928
<i>And now you owe me a favor.</i>

602
00:21:17,963 --> 00:21:20,966
And don't even think about screwing me.

603
00:21:24,274 --> 00:21:26,343
Captain, we're doing toasts.

604
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:28,313
Everyone, raise your drinks!

605
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:32,321
the 99th precinct is
officially all back together!

606
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:33,422
Nine-Nine!

607
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:34,958
Nine-Nine!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

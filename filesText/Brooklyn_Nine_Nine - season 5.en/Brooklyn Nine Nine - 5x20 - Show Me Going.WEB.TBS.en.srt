1
00:00:01,598 --> 00:00:02,789
Jake, hurry up, I'm starving.

2
00:00:02,814 --> 00:00:04,335
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,506
I just had to grab my waaaalleeeet...

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,460
Gentlemen.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,187
Fine, I was trying something,
and it didn't work!

6
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:48,019
Okay, before we get going,

7
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:50,945
Sgt. Jeffords has suggested
that it would improve morale

8
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,981
if we started the meeting

9
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:53,715
with some consensual non-work jabber.

10
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,573
I just said it might
be nice if you checked in

11
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:57,385
on the squad's personal
lives every now and then.

12
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:58,797
Exactly, jabber. Scully, go.

13
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:00,521
Well, it was just a
regular morning for me.

14
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:02,740
Woke up again with my
dog's butt on my mouth.

15
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:05,860
This experiment has failed.
Back to work talk.

16
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:07,605
Peralta, I have a case for you.

17
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,362
- Uh, that's a no-can-do, sir.
- Excuse me?

18
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:11,707
Oh. Sorry. I didn't mean to come
across like a rabble-rouser.

19
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:13,487
We're just simply unavail.

20
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:15,366
We have a meeting at a new multi-agency,

21
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,522
multi-state task force.

22
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,553
- It's a double multi.
- It's a multi-multi.

23
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,100
You're better at everything than I am.

24
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,392
- Don't say that.
- It is what it is.

25
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,054
They're taking down a street racing gang

26
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,398
that's been using souped-up cars

27
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:25,956
to transport drugs across state lines.

28
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:28,127
It's a real-life
"Fast and the Furious" movie.

29
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:30,186
Don't those movies glorify lawlessness?

30
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,153
No. They glorify family and loyalty

31
00:01:32,178 --> 00:01:33,825
and big, hard boobs on
both men and women.

32
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,625
And guess who's heading
up the task force?

33
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:36,789
Sgt. Boomer Maxwell!

34
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:37,852
- Oh!
- Damn!

35
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:39,821
Boomer Maxwell? What
kind of name is that?

36
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:42,206
Is he a football player and/or Rugrat?

37
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:44,131
Dude, he's an NYPD legend.

38
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,289
I heard he took down three
serial killers in one week.

39
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,274
I heard he defused a bomb with his teeth

40
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,598
because his hands were tied up.

41
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:51,656
I heard he bangs constantly.

42
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:53,140
Hitchcock, no chime-ins for you.

43
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:56,433
Well, good luck. I know how
competitive these task forces can be.

44
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,258
Especially this one.
Because Boomer's amazing.

45
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,133
- In bed.
- Come on, Hitchcock!

46
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:04,750
Oh, hey! What are you doing down here?

47
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:07,231
Upstairs bathroom's broken
I think Scully did it.

48
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:08,790
He says he hasn't been
in the women's bathroom,

49
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:10,850
but who else would leave a whole
rotisserie chicken in there?

50
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:12,311
Did you ask Gina to submit a work order?

51
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:13,634
Yes, but she hasn't done it yet.

52
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:15,541
She views doing her job
as quote unquote optional.

53
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:18,656
Well, I'm glad it's broken,
'cause it's nice to see you.

54
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:20,860
Now, get in that stall
and kill it in there.

55
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:22,418
- What?
- Sorry. I'm a manager now,

56
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:23,998
so I'm trying to be more motivational.

57
00:02:24,023 --> 00:02:26,037
Oh! So it's totally cool for detectives

58
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,942
to come down here and take
dumps in our bathroom?

59
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:30,354
Excuse me, Officer,
you need to check your tone.

60
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:31,668
Sorry, Sarge, but we're all sick

61
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,046
of detectives looking down on us.

62
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,429
I bet you don't even
know my name, Rosa Diaz.

63
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:36,471
Okay, look.

64
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:38,514
I get that there's always been tension

65
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,889
between uniformed
officers and detectives,

66
00:02:40,948 --> 00:02:42,881
but Rosa is one of the good guys.

67
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:44,023
I'm sure she knows your name.

68
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:45,693
You clearly just texted her the answer.

69
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:47,443
No, she didn't. Della Avocado.

70
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:49,555
- It's Alvarado.
- Stupid auto-correct.

71
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,946
I knew you were still one of them.

72
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,016
We all knew.

73
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:54,808
Great.

74
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,183
Now I'm caught in a turf war

75
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,949
between my new squad and my old squad.

76
00:02:57,974 --> 00:02:59,582
I know this is a big
deal for you as a manager,

77
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:00,620
but I gotta pee real bad.

78
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:02,405
Right. Right, right, right.
I believe in you.

79
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:03,878
Teach that toilet a lesson!

80
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:05,541
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

81
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,300
These guys are the best of the best.

82
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,477
- What, are you nervous?
- Yeah! Very. You?

83
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,070
I mean, I was, but then I looked
at Boomer's personnel file.

84
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:13,831
We both started in the same precinct,

85
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:15,981
we both took down drug gangs
our first year as detectives,

86
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:18,989
and we've both been
referred to as... El Ganador.

87
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:21,072
Oh, that's weird. I've never
heard anyone calling you that.

88
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:22,259
Well, they will soon. The point is,

89
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:24,235
I'm basically a young Boomer Maxwell.

90
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,368
Oh, you guys didn't hear?

91
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:26,727
Boomer's not running the
special unit anymore.

92
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:28,958
He shattered both his legs
jumping off the Chrysler Building

93
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:30,452
onto a passing garbage
truck during a chase.

94
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,824
Damn, that is so cool.

95
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,161
They say he'll never walk again.

96
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:34,603
Oh. Well, that's very sad.

97
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:37,455
But also still cool.
He's gonna be an Ironside!

98
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,544
Wait, if Boomer's not doing it,

99
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:39,732
who's running the task force?

100
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:41,052
Detective Brett Booth from 6-3.

101
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,762
- Oh! Cool, cool, cool.
- Uh-oh.

102
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:45,063
That was your worried
"cool, cool, cool."

103
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:47,141
- Who's Brett Booth?
- We were in the academy together.

104
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:49,331
During a training exercise,
I shot him with a rubber bullet

105
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,917
and somehow it got underneath his
goggles and hit him in the eye.

106
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:53,285
It kind of messed up
his depth perception.

107
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:54,442
Oh, but that was a long time ago.

108
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:56,737
I'm sure he's totally fine now
and he's forgotten all about it.

109
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,327
Well, well, well.

110
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:00,492
If it isn't Jake Peralta, my old...

111
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:03,122
Rogers!

112
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:04,254
It happened again!

113
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:06,132
I told you to keep the walkways clear!

114
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:08,162
You're gonna regret this, Peralta!

115
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:11,217
Ah!

116
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:14,791
Stupid Brett Booth not letting us
on his task force.

117
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:16,230
Just because you blinded him in one eye.

118
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:17,697
His other one works just fine.

119
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:19,755
No, I mean, the water cooler
thing was pretty bad.

120
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,756
- Yeah, he can't see.
- You know what, screw this.

121
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:23,728
We don't need a task
force to work the case.

122
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,578
All we have to do is solve
it before Booth is done

123
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:26,882
with his interviews in two days.

124
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:29,045
- That's impossible!
- You know I hate the word "impossible"

125
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,256
unless it's immediately followed
by the words "Ghost" and "Protocol."

126
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,600
- Shh.
<i>- Be advised.</i>

127
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,758
<i>We have a shooting or something</i>

128
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:35,882
<i>- going on in Brooklyn Heights.</i>
- What's going on?

129
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,360
There's an active shooter in
a hotel in Brooklyn Heights.

130
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:40,314
<i>Requesting additional units,
squad dispatch.</i>

131
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:41,820
Multiple casualties.

132
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:44,039
ESU is en route, and nearby officers

133
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:45,330
are responding to the scene right now.

134
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:47,870
<i>We have people running. Advising
six or seven shots fired.</i>

135
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,784
<i>Numerous civilians coming this way.</i>

136
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,796
<i>Warwick, 9238, show me going.</i>

137
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,696
<i>9238, I have you going.</i>

138
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:55,755
<i>Hilbert, 9825, show me going.</i>

139
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,727
<i>- 9825, I have you going.</i>
- What are they saying?

140
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,803
"Show me going" and their badge number.

141
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:02,589
They're telling dispatch that they're
close by and they're responding.

142
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:05,103
<i>Diaz, 3118, show me going.</i>

143
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:06,553
Diaz? Rosa Diaz?

144
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:07,748
That's her badge number.

145
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,903
Rosa's there.

146
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:18,481
So there's limited information about
the situation in Brooklyn Heights,

147
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:20,754
but I did manage to speak
to a captain at the 9-7,

148
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,926
- who offered an update.
- Do we know how many shooters?

149
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,123
Two, possibly three.

150
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:25,842
Again, the situation's still developing,

151
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,240
but as of now, there are three dead

152
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:29,968
and multiple wounded, all civilians.

153
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:31,945
So we're going up there, right?
To help Rosa?

154
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,236
ESU is on the scene,

155
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:34,617
and the 9-7 is locking down the area.

156
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:35,732
It's already a zoo.

157
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:37,521
They wanted us to remain on alert

158
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,839
- but not to respond.
- Yeah, but that's just a suggestion,

159
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:41,901
like how they tell you to drink
eight cups of water every month.

160
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,119
- A day.
- Sarge, come on.

161
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:45,814
- This is not the time for jokes.
- No, it wasn't a suggestion.

162
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:49,027
We've been ordered to go
about our business as usual.

163
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:50,627
I know you're all concerned about Rosa,

164
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:52,221
but she's not going in alone.

165
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:55,279
She's part of a massive NYPD response.

166
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:56,631
And it's Rosa, right?

167
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,293
I mean, she's a badass.

168
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:00,061
She's the toughest of all of us.

169
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:01,262
No offense, guys.

170
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:02,664
- No, that's accurate.
- Very fair.

171
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,899
I could take her. What? I'm wily.

172
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:06,745
I promise you, I will keep you updated

173
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,915
if I learn anything.

174
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,235
In the meantime, you all
have jobs to do. Dismissed.

175
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,738
Ames. She's gonna be okay.

176
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:15,495
I know.

177
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:18,152
- I love you.
- Love you too.

178
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,510
Are you done trying
to get into Amy's pants?

179
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:24,586
- What?
- I'm sorry. I'm freaking out.

180
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:25,797
Look, I'm worried too,

181
00:06:25,822 --> 00:06:27,221
but spiraling isn't gonna help anything.

182
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:28,830
We can't go up there,
so the best thing we can do

183
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,900
- is try not to think about it.
- How are supposed to do that?

184
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,387
Well, it's called compartmentalizing.

185
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:34,035
Not to brag, but when you
come from a broken home,

186
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,070
you get pretty good at it.

187
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,866
It's like, "Hey, whose bra is that

188
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:38,101
in the back seat of my dad's car?

189
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,209
I'm sure it just blew
in there on accident.

190
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,734
Anyways, off to third grade!"

191
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,185
I can't. I dwell on everything.

192
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,966
I'm a dweller. I wake up every morning,

193
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,407
I'm worrying about the Zika virus.

194
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:48,352
Why is nobody talking
about Zika anymore?

195
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:49,649
There's no way it fixed!

196
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:51,852
Okay, look. We'll just ignore
what's going on together.

197
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:53,803
Okay? Let's focus on the case.

198
00:06:54,691 --> 00:06:57,024
Let's become... street racers.

199
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:58,795
Okay, Charles.

200
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:00,276
How do I look?

201
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:02,004
So cool. How do I look?

202
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,742
Uh... you definitely made a choice.

203
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,621
- You almost look like...
- Speed Racer?

204
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:08,679
Right? This is exactly what he wears!

205
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:09,849
And the best part is...

206
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:13,677
I can use the kerchief
to start the race!

207
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,802
Well, I wanted this op to
feel normal, and... it does.

208
00:07:16,873 --> 00:07:18,326
This is quintessential Charles.

209
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:20,427
Okay. Let's go over
the backstories. I can start.

210
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:22,221
Actually, it's maybe
better for me to go first

211
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:23,322
so you can make some internal edits

212
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:24,366
before you say yours out loud.

213
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,584
- Perfect. After you.
- Great.

214
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:26,826
My name is Axel Richards.

215
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,270
I've been driving stolen cars
since I was six years old.

216
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:30,894
- Wow, that's young.
- Oh, yeah.

217
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,686
I had to use a Wiffle Ball bat
to just reach the gas pedal,

218
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,849
and I never learned to use the brakes.

219
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:35,779
- That sounds so dangerous.
- Not if you know what you're doing.

220
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:36,827
- Great response.
- Thank you.

221
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:38,937
Anyways, things went south
when I got addicted to drugs

222
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:41,272
after my best friend died in
an active shooter situation.

223
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:42,763
Oh, I see what I did there.

224
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,201
Hey. What are you doing in here?

225
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,357
Holt's scanner was making me anxious,

226
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:50,057
so I came in here to listen
to some calming music.

227
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:51,956
It's me singing the song I wrote.

228
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,240
<i>♪ Subway girl ♪</i>

229
00:07:54,545 --> 00:07:57,079
<i>♪ Gettin' all the looks ♪</i>

230
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,522
<i>♪ Holdin' onto your ♪</i>

231
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:02,778
<i>♪ Big pile of books, yeah ♪</i>

232
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:04,624
Listen. I was thinking,

233
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:05,853
Rosa seemed pretty annoyed

234
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,255
about the broken toilet up here,

235
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,257
and since she's having a rough day,

236
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,958
I thought it would be nice

237
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:12,482
if we got it fixed for
her before she got back.

238
00:08:12,506 --> 00:08:14,039
And you came to me
'cause I'm the only one

239
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:15,562
who ever gets anything done around here.

240
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:17,570
And because you were supposed
to get it fixed last week,

241
00:08:17,594 --> 00:08:19,217
so it's kind of a second chance for you.

242
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:21,246
This is a time of crisis,
so we're supposed to be

243
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:22,710
lifting each other up.

244
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:25,806
Why don't you call that plumber
I've been asking you to call

245
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:27,056
for a few hours now?

246
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:29,689
<i>All units, hold your positions.</i>

247
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:31,181
Any news, Sergeant?

248
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:33,267
Uh, last I heard,
they've located one shooter,

249
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:34,393
but they can't get to him.

250
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:36,034
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you were on the phone.

251
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,244
Oh, just on hold. What's up?

252
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:39,386
I just wanted to check in
to see if you were all right.

253
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,573
I couldn't help but notice that
you've flattened your mouse.

254
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:44,658
Sorry. I get crushy when I'm nervous.

255
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:47,211
If there's anything you want to
talk about, my door is always open.

256
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,299
Metaphorically.

257
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,522
In reality, I often keep my door closed,

258
00:08:50,606 --> 00:08:53,204
for privacy, security,
climate control...

259
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:55,305
You know what, I never even
should've used a metaphor.

260
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:56,376
I'm better than that.

261
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,816
If there's anything you
want to talk about,

262
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,546
please do so now.

263
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:00,757
There is.

264
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:03,702
I'm so scared for Rosa.

265
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:05,419
And I realized, I haven't looked at

266
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,777
my life insurance policy
since Ava was born.

267
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:09,321
I'm on hold with them now.

268
00:09:09,786 --> 00:09:11,337
Terry needs a bulkier plan!

269
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:12,797
Look, I get that you're worried

270
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:14,161
about your own mortality.

271
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,216
Perhaps this fact will comfort you.

272
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,169
As an NYPD officer,
you're more likely to be

273
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,587
crushed by scaffolding
than to die on the job.

274
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:22,642
Oh, God.

275
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:24,603
This is a city of scaffolding!

276
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:26,557
No, no, Sergeant,
I was only trying to point out

277
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:28,549
that there are millions
of potential ways to die.

278
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:30,338
Do you know how common choking is?

279
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:31,451
What are you doing, man?

280
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,482
Yeah, so this won't be a problem.

281
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,858
I can pencil you in tomorrow.

282
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:37,317
Oh. Uh, we kind of need you to fix it

283
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:38,731
before our friend gets back today.

284
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:40,224
I'm sorry, it's gonna take a while,

285
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:41,327
and I have other appointments.

286
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:42,450
Well, can you cancel them?

287
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,254
I didn't want to do this,
but our friend is a cop,

288
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:46,365
and she's caught in a Brooklyn
Heights shooting right now.

289
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:48,343
Oh! So you think you're the first people

290
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:49,734
that ever needed a toilet fixed

291
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:51,508
'cause a loved one's life was in danger.

292
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:54,551
- Yes?
- You're not. Welcome to New York.

293
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,004
That's a grim commentary
on the city we live in.

294
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,295
Refresh. No news. Refresh. No news.

295
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:03,466
Why is there no news?

296
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,411
- Charles, come on.
- Compartmentalize, remember?

297
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:07,550
Try and think happy thoughts
like the Shrek musical.

298
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:09,300
Come on, Jake,
you know they shut that down.

299
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,237
The health board said there
was too much mud on the stage!

300
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:12,905
Yeah, probably for the best.
All right, that didn't work.

301
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,732
How about this? Let's
clean up our desks.

302
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:16,390
Right? That's always
good for a distraction.

303
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:19,382
Oh, no. Rosa gave me this notepad.

304
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,047
I remember I was all,
"Anyone got a notepad?"

305
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:23,224
And she said, "Yep, here."

306
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:24,955
- Oh, my God, that's so Rosa.
- I know.

307
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,580
Okay. So, before you
can change a policy,

308
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:29,291
I'm gonna have to ask you
a few medical questions,

309
00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:31,261
- check your vitals.
- Great. Just do it fast.

310
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:33,754
- Terry knows tomorrow's not promised.
- Okay.

311
00:10:33,784 --> 00:10:35,431
Then let's start with
your blood pressure.

312
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:36,722
We can skip this part.

313
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:38,695
I always clock in at 130 over 80.

314
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,937
Terry's in tiptop.

315
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,636
Shots fired. Shots fired!

316
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,070
- What?
- Is anybody hurt?

317
00:10:43,181 --> 00:10:44,462
- I don't know.
- Oh, man.

318
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:47,421
And your BP's at 290. Oh, 350.

319
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,000
- You broke the machine.
- All right, screw this.

320
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,033
There were shots fired.

321
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:53,678
I just got off the phone.
There are two officers down.

322
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:54,934
Neither one of them is Diaz.

323
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,689
So what, are we supposed
to wait until one is?

324
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:58,701
Sir, we have to go up there.
We have to help Rosa.

325
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,626
ESU has more than enough manpower,

326
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:04,147
and we have been ordered to stay in
this precinct by the commissioner.

327
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:07,017
So what? He's not a part of our squad.
He doesn't care about her.

328
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,984
Look, I know you're concerned
about Diaz, as am I.

329
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:13,974
Nevertheless, I am ordering
you to stay in this precinct.

330
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:15,252
Fine.

331
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,037
I understand that's your order.

332
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,060
- What'd he say?
- Doesn't matter.

333
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,285
I'm gonna go help Rosa.

334
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,005
Okay, I'm going up to the
scene of the shooting,

335
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,179
and I need your help.

336
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:33,948
I can't sign tactical
gear out of the armory

337
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:35,902
without Holt's approval.
That's our mission objective.

338
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:38,101
First things first. Let's
synchronize our watches.

339
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:40,746
- These don't work.
- They're just status symbols.

340
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:41,933
Okay, we'll use our phones,

341
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,137
which are connected to the internet.

342
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,851
I don't get the internet
with my Netscape Blip.

343
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:47,087
Let's just use the regular clocks.

344
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:48,910
At 3:34, I'll go into the armory

345
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:50,757
and hand the officer in
charge a list of items.

346
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:53,081
Then, at 3:35,
you two will cause a distraction

347
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:54,875
that draws Holt into the bullpen.

348
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,587
When Holt's not looking,
I'll sneak into the office

349
00:11:56,611 --> 00:11:58,144
and answer the phone
when the armory calls

350
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:59,184
asking for approval,

351
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:01,412
fooling them with my
spot-on Holt impression.

352
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,149
"I'm Captain Holt."

353
00:12:03,174 --> 00:12:04,345
Yeah, I don't know, something feels off.

354
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:06,369
He sounds too white.
Here's how you do it.

355
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,385
No, no, that's okay! Luckily
I have a backup plan.

356
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,751
I got the Holt soundboard app from Gina.

357
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,869
<i>I'm. Raymond. Holt.</i>

358
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:15,635
<i>Get. Some. Get. Some.</i>

359
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,883
Man, soundboard Holt is so horny.

360
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:20,242
Anyways, Hitchock and Scully,
to distract the captain,

361
00:12:20,277 --> 00:12:21,785
I'm gonna need you to get in a fight.

362
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,300
- Us? The buddies?
- How would that even work?

363
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:25,514
You guys are adorable.

364
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:27,516
But we don't have time for
this, so figure it out!

365
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,110
Okay, so that plumber was useless.

366
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:33,021
But we are two smart and capable people

367
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:35,350
who can definitely figure
out how to fix a toilet.

368
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,625
Of course we can.

369
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,125
The internet will tell us what to do.

370
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:39,867
- She always does.
- Yes!

371
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,093
I'll just search "toilet videos."

372
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,342
Oh! So much porn!

373
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,895
Probably should've been more specific.

374
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:48,083
"Person fixing broken toilet."

375
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:49,894
More porn.

376
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,473
How about this? "Instructional video

377
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:55,323
from a plumber on how to
fix an actual toilet."

378
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:58,095
Still porn! How is that still porn?

379
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,968
Okay, you know what,
this isn't rocket science.

380
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:01,637
All right? The first thing we gotta do,

381
00:13:01,662 --> 00:13:02,951
shut off the water supply.

382
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:07,055
Did I do that?

383
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:11,576
That's an Urkel reference,
from the show "Family Matters."

384
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:12,643
Do you remember that?

385
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,898
Hey, there. I want to
check out some gear.

386
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:17,945
All right.

387
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:26,241
Okay. Get ready.

388
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:28,221
- It's showtime.
- What?

389
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,360
Hmm? Oh, I just said... I have Showtime.

390
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:33,665
- The cable channel.
- Mm. Must be nice.

391
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:36,476
Scully and Hitchcock are
just looking at each other.

392
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:37,797
I'm a little worried
they're not gonna be able...

393
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:40,589
You son of a bitch!

394
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,333
Okay, we're a go.

395
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:48,563
- Ah!
- Ooh!

396
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:51,409
Oh, my God, they're in a penis punch 69!

397
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:52,968
- Ooh!
- Ah!

398
00:13:53,003 --> 00:13:54,469
Hey, hey, hey!

399
00:13:57,953 --> 00:13:59,511
What's going on? Why are you fighting?

400
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:00,853
Well, he punched me in the nuts,

401
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:02,143
so I punched him in the nuts,

402
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,445
so he punched me in the nuts,

403
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,846
so I punched him in the nuts.

404
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:07,017
But why? You still haven't told me why.

405
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,665
- Um...
- Um...

406
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:12,097
Ooh!

407
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:15,059
Okay. I just need to
get Holt's approval.

408
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:16,217
Go for it.

409
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:20,290
<i>- This. Is. Holt.
- Hey.</i>

410
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:21,595
It's Officer Wilg at the armory.

411
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:22,874
I got Peralta here.

412
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,477
He's signing out body
armor and a long gun.

413
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:25,601
<i>Is he all clear?</i>

414
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:26,835
<i>Yes. Approved.</i>

415
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,637
Thanks. Oh, hey, Raymond.

416
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:31,062
Can't wait for you and Kevin
to come over and meet the baby.

417
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:32,618
We still on for Thursday, right?

418
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:35,659
<i>Screw. That.</i>

419
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:38,582
I'm sorry, I thought you
wanted to meet baby Carol.

420
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:40,160
Her surgery was such a success.

421
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:42,347
<i>Screw. That. Screw. That.</i>

422
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:44,586
<i>Get. Some. Good. Bye.</i>

423
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:45,920
Ah. What a weirdo.

424
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:47,538
Anyways, thanks for the gun.

425
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,425
Okay.

426
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,893
That should work.

427
00:14:52,231 --> 00:14:54,354
The hose thing was disconnected
from the pipe thing,

428
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:56,317
so the tub thing wasn't filling.

429
00:14:56,582 --> 00:14:59,808
Now we can just turn this back on.

430
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:02,228
And test it.

431
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:03,982
Wait, first, let's say a prayer.

432
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:07,074
Dear Beyoncé, Solange, Rihanna,

433
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,476
someone cool that's white,

434
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:10,901
Cardi B, please bless this flush.

435
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:12,584
A-woman.

436
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:15,862
Okay.

437
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:18,334
Ah! It works.

438
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,276
We did it!

439
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:22,338
Uh, what's that weird noise?

440
00:15:22,363 --> 00:15:23,370
It doesn't sound good.

441
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:24,535
No, no, no. It sounds fine.

442
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,293
That's totally normal. We fixed it.

443
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:32,766
Oh, damn.

444
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:39,684
- Gah!
- Going somewhere?

445
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:40,832
Fine, yes, you got me.

446
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:42,377
So how'd you know I was sneaking out?

447
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,799
I got a couple of very
angry texts from Officer Wilg

448
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:47,692
accusing me of quote unquote
hating my own goddaughter.

449
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:49,817
How close are you with
Colin from the armory?

450
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:51,362
Let's focus on the real question.

451
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,276
Why are you disobeying an
order from the commissioner?

452
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:55,830
I'm clearly the good guy here.

453
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:58,003
All right? If this was a movie,
no one would be on your side.

454
00:15:58,027 --> 00:15:59,307
You're basically the
guy in "Ghostbusters"

455
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:00,406
who lets all the ghosts out.

456
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,511
There's no such thing as ghosts.

457
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,141
Exactly. Now, if you'll excuse me,

458
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,174
I'm gonna go help Rosa.

459
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,877
How? This isn't a movie.

460
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:08,227
You're not gonna rush onto the scene

461
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:10,057
and singlehandedly take
down all the bad guys.

462
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,217
I might. My gun is pretty big.

463
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:12,281
It barely fits in the car.

464
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,322
Want to be a hero?

465
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:15,044
You want to actually get something done?

466
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:16,944
Your friends and colleagues right here

467
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:18,224
are struggling, and they need you.

468
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:20,258
I did everything I could.
I tried to distract me

469
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,183
and Charles all day long,
and it didn't work.

470
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,486
They don't need to be distracted.

471
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,414
They need someone to help
them face their fears

472
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:27,656
and deal with the reality
of the situation.

473
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,373
Okay, great. So why don't you do it?

474
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:30,789
I tried, but it didn't work.

475
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:33,478
I'm not particularly
skilled at emotional jabber.

476
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:34,640
I was hoping you would step up.

477
00:16:34,664 --> 00:16:37,621
And I was hoping to actually do
something valuable like help Rosa.

478
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:40,167
So are you gonna stand in my way or not?

479
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,707
Okay, I think I got it.

480
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,681
Just have to tighten this here,

481
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,667
and here we go.

482
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:00,933
Please work.

483
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:04,014
Come on.

484
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:06,483
Come on!

485
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:11,067
Flush, you stupid son of a bitch!

486
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:12,762
Ah!

487
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:21,582
Wow. Bitches really do be crazy.

488
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,551
Sorry. We should just give up.

489
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:24,928
This was such a dumb idea.

490
00:17:24,953 --> 00:17:26,751
Yeah, it would only matter
if we actually thought

491
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:28,196
Rosa was coming home today.

492
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:30,938
- We should keep going, right?
- Definitely.

493
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:34,485
Also, it's fun to watch you
get destroyed by a toilet.

494
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,368
Hello?

495
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,963
You know what,
I'm trying to keep this line open,

496
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:42,859
so I don't have time for your bull crap.

497
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:44,535
Good-bye, Mom.

498
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:47,909
I'm so sorry, how's your penis?

499
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,456
Sore. How's your penis?

500
00:17:49,481 --> 00:17:52,013
- Sore.
- I'm proud of us.

501
00:17:55,017 --> 00:17:57,791
- Still too high.
- Okay. What if I cut myself?

502
00:17:57,816 --> 00:17:58,884
Just to let some of the blood out?

503
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:00,524
I'm sorry, but I can't
stay here all day.

504
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:01,645
I have other things to do.

505
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,240
- You a traveling nurse, man.
- Don't big-time me.

506
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:07,293
I'm sorry. Look, it's been a tough day.

507
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:08,868
Hey, everyone, I got pizza.

508
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:10,787
Grab a slice.

509
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,622
Probably gonna be a really long night,

510
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:13,871
and none of you have eaten anything.

511
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:15,731
Peralta, why are you back so soon?

512
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:17,340
Because I wanted to do something.

513
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,683
Hey, guys. How're you holding up?

514
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,557
I mean, not great, but I know

515
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:23,919
you really don't want to talk about it.

516
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:25,849
No. We should talk about it.

517
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:28,113
I'm really scared for Rosa.

518
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:29,152
Me too.

519
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:30,912
And it keeps making me
think about my kids.

520
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:32,719
How do I deal with the fact

521
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,143
that every day I leave for work,

522
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:35,184
I might not come home?

523
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:37,438
Man, I don't even know, Terry.
I don't have kids yet,

524
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,158
but I know you love them.

525
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:42,488
And I feel like that's all
you can really do, right?

526
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,488
I mean, now that I'm getting married,

527
00:18:44,513 --> 00:18:45,920
I keep thinking if
something happens to me,

528
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:47,466
it'll actually affect someone else.

529
00:18:47,688 --> 00:18:49,754
I'd get over it eventually,
after a lot of therapy.

530
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,644
I was more talking about Amy,
but yes, you too, Charles.

531
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:00,087
Hey, look at that. 130 over 80.

532
00:19:00,358 --> 00:19:02,498
Back to normal. I can get
out of your hair now.

533
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,900
Nice.

534
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:05,675
Told you, Andrew.

535
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,710
Terry's in tiptop.

536
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:10,224
Thanks, Jake.

537
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:14,127
Captain. I know you don't eat pizza,

538
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:15,885
but I figured you'd want to be included.

539
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,159
Uh, thank you.

540
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:20,690
You know what would make a great movie?

541
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,425
One where the hero sits with his friends

542
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,860
and they talk about their emotions.

543
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:25,478
I know that you're just
being nice right now,

544
00:19:25,502 --> 00:19:26,607
but that would be a terrible movie.

545
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:27,963
I mean, what would the poster even be?

546
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:29,178
Just a bunch of people's faces?

547
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,333
Guys. Guys, guys, guys.

548
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,168
They just took both
shooters into custody.

549
00:19:32,193 --> 00:19:34,590
Officers got injured in the action.
They don't say how many.

550
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:36,222
Call Diaz. Get her cell.

551
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:38,409
Damn it.

552
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:40,210
It's still just going to voice mail.

553
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,172
_

554
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:47,116
Okay. I don't have the
names of the injured officers,

555
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:48,374
but if Diaz is unharmed,

556
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:49,839
she should be contacting us shortly.

557
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:51,345
Or, if her phone is dead,

558
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,610
perhaps she'll be walking out
the elevator at any moment.

559
00:19:57,611 --> 00:19:58,671
Come on, Scully!

560
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:00,151
You can't be doing stuff like that, man!

561
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:01,647
I was just making a copy downstairs.

562
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:03,124
Yeah, well, next time, think.

563
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:04,428
- About what?
- I don't know!

564
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,358
- Okay, Jake.
- Come on, man. Go easy on him.

565
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:07,846
- Diaz!
- Rosa!

566
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:09,050
You're okay! Where'd you come from?

567
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,674
Felt like walking, so I took the stairs.

568
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,304
Also, I thought it'd be
funny to mess with you guys.

569
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:13,795
Rosa, you know I hate pranks.

570
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,618
- You love pranks.
- I do. I really do.

571
00:20:16,124 --> 00:20:17,571
You did it so good.

572
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:21,189
Were you guys worried
about me or something?

573
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:22,246
No.

574
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:24,050
So what happened? Did they shoot at you?

575
00:20:24,075 --> 00:20:25,119
Were you in the thick of it?

576
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:26,998
It's been a really tough day.
I just want to get a beer.

577
00:20:27,022 --> 00:20:28,108
I don't feel like getting into it.

578
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:30,222
Are you sure? Because the journey
I went on today taught me

579
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:31,573
that sometimes it's best
to talk about things...

580
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,002
- Jake.
- Right. It was a stupid idea.

581
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:34,384
And Holt told me to do it, so.

582
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:35,854
Let's just go get a drink
and sit in total silence.

583
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:37,260
Perfect. First, I gotta go to the can.

584
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:38,940
Actually, you might want to check out

585
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:40,260
the ladies' room up here.

586
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:42,254
Hey, Rosa, it's me, Gina Linetti.

587
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:43,480
Welcome back.

588
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:45,277
Me and Amy made a little
surprise for you,

589
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:48,331
and I think you're gonna
like it very, very much.

590
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,542
Come on, girl.

591
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,136
Ta-da!

592
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,858
You made it sound like
you fixed the toilet.

593
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:55,607
Yeah, I thought maybe Amy would've

594
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,264
pulled something together
in the two minutes

595
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,377
I stepped outside.

596
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:01,212
Hey, Gina! Look what I stole
from the Barnes and...

597
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:04,844
Oh, my God, Rosa! I'm
so happy to see you!

598
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:06,622
Wait, are you covered in toilet water?

599
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:08,914
Yes, big-time. But this is happening.

600
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:09,993
Ugh. Fine.

601
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:12,344
Kinda feel like I'm lurking.

602
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,600
- Gina, get in here.
- Yay!

603
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:20,872

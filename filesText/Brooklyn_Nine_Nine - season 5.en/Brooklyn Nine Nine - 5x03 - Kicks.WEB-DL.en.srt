1
00:00:00,402 --> 00:00:01,846
Okay, we're all set up
in there, Mr. Peralta.

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,238
Just sign here.

3
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:04,807
What's all set up?
What's going on?

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,542
Ah, thank you for asking,
Terrence.

5
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:08,844
You see, the food
in prison was inedible.

6
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:10,846
All I thought
about day and night

7
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:12,615
were the things
I wished I was eating.

8
00:00:12,648 --> 00:00:14,483
And you, Amy.
I thought about you a lot.

9
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:16,619
Sex with you, just,
us doing sex with foreplay.

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,622
Great save, babe. Thanks.

11
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:21,633
And so I decided to make
my food fantasy come true.

12
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:23,993
Unbutton your pants
and take off your shoes,

13
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,962
'cause there's gonna
be a doinkload of sodium

14
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:29,599
at Freedom Feast 2017.

15
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:31,667
We begin where
all great stories begin.

16
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:34,303
In the quaint little town
of French Fry Village.

17
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:36,672
After that, we're gonna
move our adventure over

18
00:00:36,706 --> 00:00:38,574
to Cheeseburger Mountain,

19
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:40,776
which consists... you guessed
it... of turkey burgers.

20
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,678
I'm kidding, it's cheeseburgers.

21
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:44,656
This is kind of just stuffing.
You can avoid that.

22
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,349
But it's attached to
the Thanksgiving turkey theme

23
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:49,060
'cause I was thinking about
that a lot up in the jail.

24
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:51,921
And finally, we have
a big old Passover brisket

25
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:53,823
'cause you know I loves my mom.

26
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:56,992
If you would all take a seat
while I make a toast.

27
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:59,729
Kindly raise your two liters.

28
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:02,765
To freedom, to you,
and most importantly,

29
00:01:02,798 --> 00:01:04,166
to orange drank.

30
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,367
And sex with Amy.

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,036
To sex with Amy!

32
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,776
Sorry. Shouldn't have
said that last part.

33
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:29,792
Oink, oink.

34
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:31,093
Good morning, sir.

35
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:33,062
Your expression
is inscrutable as always.

36
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:34,730
And yours is extremely
scrutable.

37
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:36,165
You want something.

38
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:37,633
A video game, perhaps?

39
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:38,834
Or a fidget spinner?

40
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:39,978
I do want both of those things,

41
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:41,937
but that's not why I'm here.

42
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,749
I'm back and I'm ready for
a case, so what do you got?

43
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:45,875
A murder? A sui?
A murder-sui?

44
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:47,777
They often follow one another.

45
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,387
Ooh, maybe you've got
an avunculicide up in there?

46
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:51,046
The murder of an uncle.

47
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,815
I'm surprised you know
what that word means.

48
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:54,717
I learned about a lot
of new crimes in prison.

49
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,051
Those people real bad.

50
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:57,720
You know
you can't work a case yet.

51
00:01:57,753 --> 00:01:59,689
You've been assigned
to desk duty.

52
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:00,866
Oh, please. Don't make me
sit behind a desk all day.

53
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,091
That's worse than prison.

54
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:03,926
No, it's not.
Prison real bad.

55
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,036
Those are the rules
for anyone experiencing

56
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,161
a traumatic work-lapse.

57
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:07,730
It wasn't that traumatic.

58
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:09,064
You just said, and I quote,

59
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:10,833
"Prison real bad."

60
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:11,763
Look, I'm ready.
I'm the same old Jake.

61
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:12,840
I don't know why
you have an issue with this.

62
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,165
Rosa was happy to comply.

63
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,342
So, what, now I'm just supposed

64
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:17,102
to do anything that Rosa does?

65
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:18,770
I mean, what if she
jumped off a cliff?

66
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,238
If Rosa were
to jump off a cliff,

67
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:22,073
she would've done her
due diligence regarding

68
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:23,550
the height of the cliff,
the depth of the water,

69
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:25,176
and the angle of entry,
so... yes.

70
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,988
If you see Rosa jump off
a cliff, by all means.

71
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:28,313
Jump off a cliff.

72
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:29,314
You jump off a cliff.

73
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:30,548
Gladly.

74
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:32,851
Provided Rosa did first.

75
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:33,952
Hey. Babe.

76
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:35,320
You forgot your lunch at home.

77
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:37,255
Aww, thanks Adrian.
You're the sweetest.

78
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:39,124
Aww, of course.

79
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:40,868
I French kissed every
slice of meat in that sandwich.

80
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:42,027
Pimento, welcome back.

81
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,294
How was Argentina?

82
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,996
Eh, it was
kind of boring, actually.

83
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,832
Although, one funny thing
did happen to me.

84
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,939
Still feels like you and I

85
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:55,883
have a different idea
about what a funny thing is.

86
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:57,275
Right? Anyway.
I should boogie.

87
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:58,977
What?
Say good-bye to mommy.

88
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,846
Ooh, don't mind if I do.

89
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,381
All right,
I'm just gonna look over here.

90
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:05,350
- Okay. I'm doing that thing.
- Man.

91
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:07,061
- I think it's still happening.
- I'm still hearing it.

92
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,887
Phew!

93
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,024
Hang on. Were you creeps
watching that the whole time?

94
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:12,290
- Well...
- Uh...

95
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:14,059
I'm just kidding.
I know you were.

96
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:15,903
It's like an eclipse.
You should always look at it

97
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:18,930
with both eyes wide open.
Full on. You're welcome.

98
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,131
I love you, babe.

99
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:21,599
- Love you too.
- Yeah!

100
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:23,935
Must be so nice
having Pimento back.

101
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:25,379
I mean, you shouldn't
eat that sandwich.

102
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:27,172
Something's wrong.
He's acting weird...

103
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:28,373
- Er than normal?
- Yes.

104
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:30,175
He's not telling me something.

105
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,385
You guys did spend
several months apart.

106
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:32,878
Maybe it's all in your head.

107
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:34,312
Oh.
Bitches be crazy,

108
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:35,389
is that what
you're saying, Terry?

109
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:37,615
What?
No, no.

110
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:40,018
I did not say that.
I would never say that.

111
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:41,186
Not cool, Terry.

112
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,188
My relationship's in trouble.

113
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:44,956
Terry loves women!

114
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,992
Women be sane!

115
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:52,454
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your life,

116
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:53,488
desk brother.

117
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:54,622
I don't think so.

118
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:55,657
This is just temporary.

119
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,392
That's what I said.

120
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:59,361
Join us, Jake.

121
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:01,396
You know you want to.

122
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:04,499
Both: We're going to Wingsluts.

123
00:04:04,532 --> 00:04:06,534
My God. Charles!

124
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:07,869
Charles, Charles, Charles!

125
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:09,337
What's wrong?

126
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,672
Going crazy over here, man.

127
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:12,507
The only worthwhile thing
I've done today

128
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,717
was take a Buzzfeed quiz
about what kind of onion I am.

129
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:16,444
Hm. Vidalia.

130
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,679
Ah. Cipollini.

131
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:19,381
That was not
the point of my story.

132
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:20,591
- Oh.
- Desk duty is a nightmare.

133
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:21,692
Name one thing someone
accomplished

134
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:23,385
while sitting behind a desk.

135
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:25,086
Abraham Lincoln
abolished slavery.

136
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,697
Yeah, but think about how
much faster he would've done it

137
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:28,466
if he'd got off his ass
once in a while, right?

138
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,867
Well, just tell me what
you're working on, huh?

139
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,826
Before the stapling starts
again, please? Please?

140
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:33,571
- I don't know if I should.
- Charles, Charles, Charles!

141
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:35,497
I need this, man.
Just give me a little taste.

142
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:37,932
- Grand larceny.
- No!

143
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:39,501
- Ow!
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

144
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:40,868
I just...
I love grand larceny.

145
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:42,470
I know.
I didn't wanna bring it up.

146
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:43,847
It'll never happen again,
just...

147
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:45,440
Who got robbed?

148
00:04:45,473 --> 00:04:46,783
- Sneaker store.
- I hope you die!

149
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:48,443
- Ah!
- Oh! That was way too harsh.

150
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:49,911
Charles, forgive me.

151
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:51,455
This is crazy, right?
It doesn't seem fair.

152
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:52,447
I should be working this case.

153
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,448
Yeah.

154
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:54,649
I will work this case.

155
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:55,726
There's gotta be
a way to fix it.

156
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,918
And I'm gonna figure it out.

157
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:58,386
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

158
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,854
Yeah!

159
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:01,565
Wow, throwing your file
all over the place, Charles?

160
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:02,557
Really immature.
Yeah, you're right.

161
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,891
I'll go clean it up.

162
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:05,793
Well, figured out
what's off with Pimento.

163
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,128
He's cheating on me.

164
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:08,696
- No.
- Oh, Rosa.

165
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,598
I found his
credit card statement.

166
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:12,476
There's a charge for
a restaurant called La Palapa.

167
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,902
Two entrees. One flan.

168
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:16,738
- One flan?
- One flan.

169
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:17,872
- That's cold.
- Yeah.

170
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:19,541
Cold.

171
00:05:19,574 --> 00:05:20,675
I'm so confused.

172
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,752
Both: They shared the flan!

173
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:23,478
Okay, but...

174
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:24,722
That seems like
a bit of a stretch.

175
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:26,548
Nope.
When it comes to cheating,

176
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:28,583
you gotta pay attention
to all the signs.

177
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:29,917
During my year abroad in Japan,

178
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:31,519
I learned that the hard way.

179
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:32,620
Chiaki...

180
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:45,199
There was no Japanese tea sock.

181
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:46,801
But there was a Japanese man.

182
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,636
I wasted a year on Chiaki.

183
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,971
So, what should I do?

184
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:51,181
Maybe don't jump to conclusions.

185
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:52,607
No! Interrogate him!

186
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,576
Follow the flan, Rosa.

187
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:55,810
Follow the flan.

188
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:56,911
Right.

189
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:58,646
Follow the flan.

190
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,815
Guess what
I'm holding behind my back?

191
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:02,650
Before we begin,

192
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:04,519
what are the parameters
of the guessing game?

193
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:05,763
How many guesses do I get?
Is there a time limit?

194
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:07,489
Forget it.
You ruin everything.

195
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:08,599
It's the police code
and ethics manual.

196
00:06:08,623 --> 00:06:09,924
Chapter four. Page 83.

197
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:11,225
You should not have told me.

198
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:12,660
I never would've guessed it.

199
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:13,995
Now I've won.

200
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:15,830
This.
This is what I've missed.

201
00:06:15,863 --> 00:06:18,199
It clearly states that
I can get off of desk duty if

202
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:20,201
I pass a field evaluation
performed by a member

203
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,537
of the Municipal Police
Training Council.

204
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,572
That's right.
It's a loophole.

205
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:25,707
Loophole high five.

206
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,041
- Loop...
- Hole.

207
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:29,677
- Loop...
- Hole!

208
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:31,054
Enough. This is
highly inappropriate.

209
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:32,947
Did you also see
where it states,

210
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,950
"If you fail the evaluation,
you will be suspended"?

211
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:37,552
I would have to take
your gun and badge.

212
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:39,053
I'm not worried about that.

213
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:40,798
I swear to my personal Lord
and Savior, Steph Curry,

214
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:42,256
I'm ready.

215
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:44,258
I think you're rushing.
It's a bad idea.

216
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,661
Doesn't matter. I'm allowed
to demand my own evaluation.

217
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:48,071
Yes, but as your
commanding officer,

218
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:51,499
I choose the evaluator.
And I choose...

219
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,500
Me.

220
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:53,801
Wait. What?

221
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:55,703
I'm a qualified member
of the MPTC.

222
00:06:55,737 --> 00:06:56,704
I'll administer it.

223
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:58,506
All right. Fine.

224
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,807
I'll pass your dumb evaluation

225
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,609
and crack this case.
Bring it on.

226
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:02,977
- I will.
- Good.

227
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,012
- Good.
- You're good. But I'm better.

228
00:07:05,046 --> 00:07:06,724
And I'm gonna ace this thing
before you can even...

229
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:07,858
Oh, wait, wait,
what are you writing down?

230
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:09,283
Sir? What are you writing down?

231
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:10,985
Charles...
What's he writing?

232
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:12,987
- Write something good.
- Write something good.

233
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,557
We're just gonna leave.
Just stop writing.

234
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,767
Just stop writing.
Stop writing.

235
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,992
- Unless it's good.
- No.

236
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,036
- Is it good?
- Is it good?

237
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,261
We're gonna go. Sir?

238
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:21,295
Write something good.

239
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:22,597
Write something good.

240
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,707
It looks like the perp
knew what he was after.

241
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:28,342
All he took was a shipment
of thousand dollar

242
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:31,336
limited edition Weezies
designed by Little Wayne.

243
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,703
Oh, it's Lil.

244
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:33,904
- Oh, like Lillian.
- No.

245
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:35,306
Lillian Wayne. Okay.

246
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,041
Okay.

247
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:39,777
Captain, I hope you're
wearing your evaluating pants,

248
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,087
'cause I'm about to put on
a crime solving clinic.

249
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,780
I am wearing
my evaluating pants.

250
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,048
What? 'Cause I was just...

251
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:45,816
Wait, what are evaluating pants?

252
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,394
They have a deep bottom
pocket for my notepad,

253
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:49,820
and they don't crease,
which is a must,

254
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:52,056
given how much
I squat during an evaluation.

255
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:54,892
Mmkay, well there were
no witnesses to the crime,

256
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:56,837
which is weird since there was
a long line of sneaker-heads

257
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:58,805
right outside the window,
and you're actually squatting.

258
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:00,064
Just, uh, ignore me.

259
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:02,032
Unless you can't.

260
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,934
It's not a problem.
I love ignoring you.

261
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,446
Don't write that down.
But continuing with the case,

262
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,813
There were no signs
of forced entry.

263
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,038
- Hm.
- No fingerprints.

264
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,707
- Hmm.
- And no DNA evidence.

265
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,951
- Hmm.
- Okay, I can't ignore you.

266
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:12,677
What are you writing down there?

267
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,954
Probably that
you're crushing it, Jake,

268
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:15,112
because you are crushing it.

269
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:16,814
Are you trying to squat a peek?

270
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:18,383
Of course I'm trying
to squat a peek,

271
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,351
but I also might be
solving the case.

272
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:21,862
Charles, come take a look at
this... there's a security camera

273
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:23,721
across the street
we didn't see before.

274
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,756
I have a feeling our answers
are in that footage.

275
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,358
Squat five.

276
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:28,893
- Too far.
- I'll move closer.

277
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,928
- Still too far.
- A little closer.

278
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:32,363
- Getting closer.
- There we go.

279
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:36,434
Worth it.

280
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:39,904
I followed the flan.

281
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,080
I confronted Pimento about
La Palapa and he lied to me.

282
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:45,886
He denied ever even
hearing about the restaurant.

283
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,778
- Hmm, that is strange.
- And this morning,

284
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,380
he left the house
in clean clothes.

285
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:50,815
He never does that.
Never?

286
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,116
You need to follow him.

287
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:53,560
Catch him with his spoon
in the flan.

288
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:55,453
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

289
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:56,930
I need to check out
a full surveillance kit.

290
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,155
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

291
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:00,090
That's against the rules.
Sarge?

292
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:02,159
There are no rules when
it comes to cheating, Amy.

293
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:03,861
I totally agree.

294
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:05,730
But unfortunately,
the NYPD does not.

295
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:07,932
I can't lend you department
equipment for personal use.

296
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,167
But there may be a work-around.
Hitchcock!

297
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,437
You have any surveillance
equipment Rosa can borrow?

298
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,071
You mean my creep kit?

299
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:16,441
No prob.
Got another one in the car.

300
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:18,843
See, Amy? That's what
a real friend looks like.

301
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,480
Okay.
Security footage came in.

302
00:09:22,513 --> 00:09:24,449
Let's see what we got.

303
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,083
Probably a huge break.

304
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:27,828
Well, let's not put too much
pressure on it.

305
00:09:27,852 --> 00:09:29,587
You're right.
It's probably a dead end.

306
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,931
- Also not helpful.
- Let's just watch the footage.

307
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:32,557
Yes. Great. All right, so,

308
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,859
here we have the camped-out
line of sneaker-heads.

309
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:36,169
Not much going on
around midnight.

310
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:37,795
Let's just fast-forward.
It's okay.

311
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,172
Still pretty calm
at around 1:00 a.m.

312
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:41,065
- That's all right.
- Fast forward.

313
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:42,843
And also looking a little bit
slow around 3:00 a.m.

314
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:45,536
So, basically it shows nothing.

315
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,472
Or...

316
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:48,906
Does it show everything?

317
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:50,508
Ooh!

318
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,443
Sorry not sorry.
It was just a stupid pencil.

319
00:09:52,477 --> 00:09:54,078
It was a gift
from my deceased father.

320
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:56,146
A pencil?
Your dad gave pretty bad gifts.

321
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:59,493
Although on the other hand,
all my dad ever gave me

322
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:00,961
was abandonment issues,
so, potato-tomato.

323
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:02,953
But look at this.
Right around 4:00 a.m.,

324
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:04,455
the line moves down.

325
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:06,991
Everyone except
for that blue pup tent,

326
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,893
which is interesting.

327
00:10:08,926 --> 00:10:10,595
Oh, my boy's got a hunch.

328
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:12,096
He's got bunches of hunches.

329
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:13,898
I think they didn't move down

330
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:15,075
because they didn't care
about their place in line.

331
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:16,801
I believe all they cared about

332
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,236
was the placement
of their tent, which was...

333
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:22,573
Right over this manhole cover.

334
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:25,910
And I wonder what's behind this.

335
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:27,244
Hayouken!

336
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:28,946
Oh, look.

337
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:30,581
It's the sneaker store
stock room.

338
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:32,883
Whoa.
How does he do it, folks?

339
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,218
It was a team effort, Boyle.

340
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:35,653
Humble five?
You know it.

341
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:37,588
Both: Uh, I couldn't possibly.

342
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:39,089
Of course we still have no idea

343
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:40,591
who was in the blue pup tent.

344
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,135
You know what?
There is no pleasing you.

345
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,961
That is accurate.

346
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:47,932
What do you want?

347
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:49,166
- Hey.
- Hi, Rosa.

348
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,001
How's the Pimento
stake out going?

349
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,837
Has he done anything
suspicious yet?

350
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,605
No.
Just regular Pimento stuff.

351
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:02,122
Ugh. It's like
he's going all norm-core

352
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:03,948
to through me off the scent.

353
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:06,183
Or maybe it could be
Pimento wasn't cheating on you.

354
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:08,052
What? You sound like
a real Amy right now.

355
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,654
- Hey.
- I know,

356
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,656
but even a broken Amy
can be right twice a day.

357
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:13,524
Hey!

358
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:15,602
We went to lunch at La Palapa
and we shared the flan.

359
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:16,894
Oh, so you two are boning now?

360
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,162
Both: No!

361
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:20,130
The flan's huge.
Everyone shares it.

362
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:22,099
The restaurant tells you to.
Hmm.

363
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:24,301
Maybe it's time to put
the creep kit away, Rosa.

364
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,003
Wait.

365
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:27,113
Pimento just walked up
to a woman.

366
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:28,272
A female woman?

367
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:31,241
Rosa, is it a female woman?

368
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,242
They just kissed.

369
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,611
Oh, no.

370
00:11:33,644 --> 00:11:35,079
I'm so sorry, Rosa.

371
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,180
Whatever.

372
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:38,115
Hope you enjoyed the flan.

373
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:41,586
So, what's this about
a giant flan?

374
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:44,121
The manager at the store
recognized the pup tent

375
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:46,156
from two previous
sneaker launches.

376
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,059
And he ID'd the owner
as one Morris Richman.

377
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:52,129
Who just so happens
to work for Con Ed,

378
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:53,964
on underground electrical wires.

379
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:58,035
He also just so happens
to live a-right a-here.

380
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,672
You might wanna squat for this,
Mr. Evaluator.

381
00:12:01,706 --> 00:12:04,241
I decide when
the squatting is necessary.

382
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:09,914
This was my choice.

383
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:12,116
- Can I help you?
- NYPD.

384
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,283
Are you Morris Richman?

385
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,685
- Yes.
- And are those

386
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,753
Weezies?

387
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,287
Yes.

388
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,089
- Well done, Peralta.
- Thank you.

389
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:22,192
But it wasn't me.
It was Steph...

390
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:24,261
Working through me.

391
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:25,996
What is going on?

392
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,632
Oh, he's been evaluating me.

393
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:29,209
It's been up and down,
but this is a clear win.

394
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:31,001
Oh, sorry, you mean
what's going on with you?

395
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:32,603
You're under arrest
for grand larceny.

396
00:12:32,637 --> 00:12:33,938
I didn't do anything.

397
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,040
Is this about the Weezies?

398
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:37,341
A friend gave them to me.

399
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:39,710
I'm innocent.
Come on, man, I'm innocent.

400
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:41,178
Sure you are, buddy.

401
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:43,313
We all know you did it.

402
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:49,787
Charles!

403
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,956
We arrested the wrong guy.
- What?

404
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:54,370
Morris Richman didn't do it.
We have to fix this right now.

405
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:57,382
I'll wait for you
to not be naked.

406
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,666
This is really bad, Charles.

407
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:00,809
Jake, can you please
spiral a little quieter?

408
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,635
Nikolaj is still asleep

409
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:03,946
and if he hears two men
arguing in the next room,

410
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,605
he might think
he's getting sold again.

411
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:07,239
Aww, man,
his backstory is so sad.

412
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:08,775
- I know.
- Look.

413
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:10,577
I don't know how I screwed
this up, I mean,

414
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,555
maybe Holt got in my head
with all of his squatting.

415
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:13,889
- It was a powerful image.
- I think I rushed this all

416
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:15,648
so I could pass the evaluation.
Bottom line,

417
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:16,749
we arrested the wrong guy.

418
00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:18,317
What about the pup tent?

419
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,028
And the manhole?
And he was wearing Weezies.

420
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:21,830
Maybe his friend gave them
to him just like he said.

421
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:23,255
We have no physical evidence

422
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:24,757
tying him to the stock room.

423
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:25,934
Plus, where are the rest
of the sneakers?

424
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,326
Okay. So,

425
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,928
do we tell Captain Holt?

426
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:30,706
No. Then he'll fail me
and I'll get suspended.

427
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,565
We gotta solve this on our own.

428
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:35,668
And I think I know how.
I found a lead on the dark web.

429
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:37,570
Nice. The dark web.

430
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:39,047
It's the only place
you can buy quality bat meat.

431
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:41,708
Mm. Gross.
Anyways, I posted a message

432
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:44,577
looking for Weezies and
I got pointed to MizzBK-Sneaks.

433
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:46,012
She put this pic up yesterday.

434
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,914
Ah.
Those are our stolen shoes.

435
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:49,348
But who's MizzBK-Sneaks?

436
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:51,283
Her name is Jenny McFadden.

437
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:53,662
She moves her merch out of the
back of a bodega on Willoughby.

438
00:13:53,686 --> 00:13:55,297
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
All right, one problem.

439
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:56,999
If we go to the bodega
looking like detectives,

440
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:58,324
we'll spook her.

441
00:13:58,357 --> 00:13:59,726
Right you are, Charles my chum.

442
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,869
But we won't
look like detectives.

443
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:02,962
I brought all my best sneakers.

444
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:04,864
Get your fat, sweaty feet ready.

445
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:06,298
Yeah.

446
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:08,300
We're gonna look
flippity-dippity-fly.

447
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:11,877
Hey. So, you doing okay?

448
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:14,680
Not really.

449
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:15,924
I waited outside
that restaurant for two hours

450
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:17,082
and he never came out.

451
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:18,083
Cantaloupe?

452
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:19,151
I'm good. Amy?

453
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:20,886
Also good. Also good.

454
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,688
I spent the whole night
riding my bike,

455
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:24,724
just thinking and riding,
riding and thinking.

456
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:26,134
Also, I drank some water
from the stream.

457
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,060
And what did you figure out?

458
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:29,805
I'm gonna dump his ass.
He should be here any minute.

459
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:31,072
Oh, you're gonna do it
at work. That's great.

460
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:32,832
There you are.

461
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:33,975
Babe, I've been
looking for you all night.

462
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,868
You didn't come home.

463
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:37,445
'Cause I knew if I did,
I would stab you in the face.

464
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:39,805
Oh, Terry, we have
the thing in the other room.

465
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,406
- Mm-hmm.
- Phone...

466
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,442
Yeah. Meeting. Uh, work.
Friend lunch. Yep.

467
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:46,846
So is this
a sexy stab in the face?

468
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,480
Or an angry stab in the face?

469
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,382
Don't play dumb with me.

470
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:52,227
I know about your mistress.
I know about La Palapa.

471
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:53,886
I know about the flan.

472
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,063
- Babe, wait.
- Oh, I've been waiting.

473
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:57,089
I waited all night to do this.

474
00:14:57,122 --> 00:14:58,457
We're done. It's over.

475
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,860
What? No.

476
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:03,462
I don't have a mistress.

477
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:05,865
That woman's name
is Señora Reyes.

478
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:07,132
She's my Spanish teacher.

479
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,834
- Oh, please.
- No, I'm serious.

480
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:10,145
The only reason
we were even at La Palapa

481
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:11,871
was so I can practice
ordering in Spanish.

482
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:13,105
Ah... by the way...

483
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,042
It did?

484
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:26,418
Oh, my God.

485
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:28,087
Oh, my God.

486
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,489
Adrian, I'm so sorry.
You must be so mad at me.

487
00:15:30,522 --> 00:15:32,157
What? No, of course
I'm not mad at you.

488
00:15:32,191 --> 00:15:34,894
Are you kidding? Jealousy's,
like, the hottest emotion.

489
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:35,961
Let's do this.

490
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:37,062
Okay, let's do it.

491
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,801
All right. This guy
looks like the gatekeeper.

492
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,135
Just follow my lead.
Okay.

493
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:46,839
Hey, how are ya?

494
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:49,008
Just grabbing a couple things.

495
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,912
Ham puffs, a single tampon,
and a hot rod magazine?

496
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:54,513
- Know how we do.
- Ahh.

497
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:58,150
Hey, listen, we're looking
to score some kicks.

498
00:15:58,183 --> 00:15:59,151
You know where we can find some?

499
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:00,986
Yeah. The mall.

500
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,889
The mall. What do we look
like, Jay and Silent Bob?

501
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:09,895
Actually, yeah.

502
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:11,263
Fair enough.

503
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:12,908
Look, we're friends
with Jenny McFadden.

504
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:16,035
Okay.
Well, if that's true,

505
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,270
tell me what her
favorite shoe is.

506
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:20,772
Old school Impala All-Stars.

507
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:24,543
- Okay. I'll go get her.
- Great.

508
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,245
I can't believe that worked.

509
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,156
I just guessed the coolest shoe
I knew and I was right.

510
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,180
Nope, he's running away.

511
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:33,518
Ugh, these shoes
are so uncomfortable!

512
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:35,087
They're dress sneakers,

513
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,521
you're not supposed
to run in them.

514
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:39,024
Freeze!

515
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:41,060
NYPD. Let me see your hands.

516
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:42,828
I didn't do anything.

517
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:44,196
Then why were you running?

518
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:45,306
I didn't want any trouble.
I have two priors.

519
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,932
Where is Jenny McFadden?

520
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:48,500
There is no Jenny McFadden.

521
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,345
That's a cover for the dude
who steals the shoes.

522
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,037
His name is Morris Richman.

523
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:53,906
Oh, no.

524
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:55,283
No, no, no, no, no.
Why are you freaking out?

525
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,351
This is great.
You were right all along.

526
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,077
It was Morris Richman.

527
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,187
You'll definitely pass
your evaluation now.

528
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:01,246
Yeah, the only thing is...

529
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,149
You let Morris Richman go?

530
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:08,153
Single tampon?

531
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,976
I am in shock, Peralta.

532
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:12,811
I can't believe
you released Morris Richman.

533
00:17:12,844 --> 00:17:14,079
We have evidence.

534
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:16,047
Great evidence that Jake found.

535
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:18,092
Exactly, which makes it even
worse that he let him go.

536
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:20,127
That's not fair. I was trying
to help, but he tricked me.

537
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:22,153
You blew this case.
You bungled your evaluation,

538
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:24,823
and you never retrieved
my father's pencil.

539
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:26,468
Sir, I am happy
to get you a new pencil.

540
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:27,802
It won't be the same.
And now you're just

541
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:29,160
standing here, mum as a mouse.

542
00:17:29,194 --> 00:17:30,829
Have you nothing to say
for yourself?

543
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:32,764
- I can explain.
- Of course he can.

544
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:34,900
My boy's got bunches
of explunches. Hit 'em, Jake.

545
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:36,935
I'm not ready to be back.

546
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,770
You should suspend me.
What?

547
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:41,907
Look, when we arrested Richman

548
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,543
and he said he didn't do it,
I just...

549
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:46,144
I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

550
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:47,779
I mean, what if he was
telling the truth?

551
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:49,114
What if he was innocent

552
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:51,182
and I was putting
an innocent man in jail?

553
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:53,051
It's just...

554
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:55,186
Feels a lot harder for me
to put another human being

555
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,789
in prison after
experiencing it myself.

556
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:59,157
It's really horrible.

557
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,859
Look, I wanted
to be back in the field,

558
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,260
because I wanted
to be the old me,

559
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:05,964
but the truth is,
I'm not the old me yet.

560
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:07,232
Maybe I never will be.

561
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,770
Anyways, I'm gonna
go cry in the bathroom.

562
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:13,805
Peace out, homies.

563
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,944
Hey. What's going on?

564
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:20,512
I thought everything worked out.

565
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:21,856
Is there a reason
you're still upset?

566
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,214
What makes you think I'm upset?

567
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:25,150
The giant hole
you carved into the table.

568
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:26,985
Oops. Didn't notice.

569
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:29,588
There. Fixed it.

570
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,256
Look, I get it.

571
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:32,934
You feel guilty about
accusing him of cheating.

572
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,960
That's on me.

573
00:18:34,993 --> 00:18:37,563
I encouraged you because of all
my unresolved Chiaki issues.

574
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:42,267
No, it's not that, it's just...

575
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,202
Last night, when I ended
things with Adrian,

576
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:46,538
I had this huge feeling
of relief.

577
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:48,073
It's the first time in
a long time

578
00:18:48,106 --> 00:18:49,541
that I felt like myself again.

579
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:51,209
Oh, Rosa.

580
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:52,854
I think I got so worked up
about him cheating on me

581
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:54,312
because I wanted it to be true.

582
00:18:54,345 --> 00:18:56,214
I needed an excuse
to end things.

583
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:59,184
And now I don't know what to do.

584
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:01,252
I think you do know what to do.

585
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,955
Thanks, Amy.

586
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,260
I have no idea
what she's gonna do

587
00:19:09,294 --> 00:19:11,005
but that's the safest way
to give Rosa advice.

588
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:12,163
Yep.

589
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:15,200
Packing your desk.

590
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,968
That's a major downer.

591
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:18,670
Yeah, so why
are you smiling like that?

592
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:20,071
We found Morris Richman.

593
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:21,840
Nuh-uh, Jake found him.

594
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:23,575
We talked about this, Boyle.

595
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:24,919
We agreed that if you
couldn't keep it together,

596
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:25,911
you couldn't be a part of this.

597
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:27,012
I'll be good.

598
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:29,290
We went through your case file,

599
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:31,049
and everything
we needed was there.

600
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:33,318
Richman's aliases,
his known associates,

601
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:35,887
and an address in Queens
that he used as a safe house.

602
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:37,155
The 2-7 just picked him up.

603
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:38,156
Tell him the other stuff.
Tell him.

604
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:39,224
Tell him now.

605
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:40,892
Yeah. I can't be here.

606
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,228
When you demanded
to be put back on the field,

607
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,954
I worried
that you were being flippant

608
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,689
about your time in prison.

609
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:52,091
I thought you would
be reckless, but I was wrong.

610
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,694
Prison has made you
more cautious.

611
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:57,430
Yeah, but what if
I'm too cautious now?

612
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,308
I mean, I used to see
everything as black and white,

613
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,701
and now,
it's looking real gray to me.

614
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:04,403
I wish every cop had a voice
in their head asking,

615
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,272
what if he's innocent?

616
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,374
You see it as weakness,
but it means you're growing.

617
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,810
It makes you a better detective.

618
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,245
So, you passed your evaluation.

619
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,713
You can go back in the field.

620
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,348
Oh.

621
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,284
Wow.

622
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,053
Thank you for passing me.

623
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,387
But I actually feel like

624
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,757
I need a little bit
more time to readjust.

625
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,125
I think I should ride the desk
for a few more weeks.

626
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,262
I respect that.

627
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,775
Okay, Charles,
you can come hug us now.

628
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,133
We know you're still there.

629
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,735
- I never left.
- Ugh!

630
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,136
Thank you for understanding.

631
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,271
Yeah.

632
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,273
Oh. Look.

633
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,275
Oh, boy.

634
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,278
- Here's your blood back.
- Mm.

635
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,181
Well, in that case,

636
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,049
I guess you should have
your blood back too.

637
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,818
What? How did you get this?

638
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,362
You know, I might want
a couple minutes up here alone.

639
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:56,055
Just to kinda process this,
you know.

640
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,457
Of course.

641
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,767
So, how'd it go?

642
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,270
It actually went
surprisingly well...

643
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,043
No! Rosa!

00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,515
NYPD.

314
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:58,232
Hello? Is there a problem?

315
00:09:58,257 --> 00:09:59,624
We're looking for Frank Gillespie.

316
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:01,258
Frank? He died a year ago.

317
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:03,592
- What? What happened?
- Well, his lymphoma came back.

318
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:06,123
But really, it was the
loneliness that killed him.

319
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,685
Somebody hurt him, and he just
couldn't make friends after that.

320
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,872
So it seems like he died because of me.

321
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:13,960
Just gonna lock that up in a little
box in my brain and never open it.

322
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:15,709
Hey, do you remember Dario Moretti,

323
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:17,207
that money launderer I arrested?

324
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:18,864
He lives right around here too.

325
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,217
- So?
- He hated me.

326
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:23,093
What if this is the work of
my arch-nemesis and not yours?

327
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,866
So you're suggesting I'm
not involved in this at all?

328
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,819
[LAUGHING] I mean, you
hear yourself, right?

329
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:29,886
- That's a bit of a stretch.
- Yeah, Amy.

330
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:32,289
Are you actually mad that
someone might not hate you?

331
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:33,511
Yeah, I am, Amy!

332
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:35,012
Oh, wow, that's a bad
color on me, isn't it?

333
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:36,571
All right, fine, we'll
check out your guy

334
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,611
and I'll be totally fine
with it if it's him.

335
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:41,021
Oh, man, you got a whole shrine!

336
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:42,821
Even the eyes are all scratched out.

337
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:44,883
Babe, when we're married,
we're gonna share everything.

338
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:47,404
Bank accounts,
health insurance, arch-nemeses.

339
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:49,802
Aww, that's nice, Ames,
but you don't have to say that.

340
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,219
Charles, will you put this
picture of me up on the wall?

341
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:52,446
Copy that. You want the
eyes scratched out?

342
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,733
Uh, you know I do.

343
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:59,025
Lieutenant Wells? Where is Teddy?

344
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,856
- Hi, Jakey.
- Aunt Linda.

345
00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:02,929
What are you doing here?
How'd you get past the police barricade?

346
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,061
Well, I moved them.

347
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:06,662
Now, I know I was supposed
to come here solo,

348
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,585
but I had to invite my friend Barb.

349
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,926
She was so down in the dumps.

350
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,396
Yeah, that's all fine.
Don't worry about it.

351
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,513
Actually, you know what?
That's not fine.

352
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,466
Barb can't be here.
You can't just add someone day of.

353
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,555
Oh, hey guys, what's up?

354
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:17,025
Teddy, meet Dario.

355
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,622
He has a wall full of Amy photos,

356
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:20,190
and he's the one that
made the bomb threat.

357
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:21,610
And I'm Aunt Linda.

358
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:23,113
Okay, Aunt Linda,
I love you but you gotta go.

359
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:24,550
Okay? Thank you. Give us a moment here.

360
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:26,831
All right, Dario, tell Lieutenant
Wells what you told us.

361
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:29,126
Okay, I've hated Detective Santiago

362
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,719
since she arrested me, and then I saw

363
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:32,134
that engagement
announcement in the paper.

364
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,580
But you could have figured
out where the wedding was

365
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:35,966
- even without that, right?
- No, I was trying.

366
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:37,169
I had totally given up, really.

367
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:38,604
Oh, God, what have I done?

368
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,187
Anyway, I made the threat,
but there's no bomb.

369
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:42,971
Just like I've been saying all along.

370
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:44,789
Now, can we please go back in the venue?

371
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:46,552
First of all, there's
nothing inherently creepy

372
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:47,906
about a wall of Amy photos.

373
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:49,144
- Uh-huh.
- Secondly,

374
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:50,343
I'm not gonna just take this guy's word

375
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,451
for it that there's no bomb.

376
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:52,834
Why not? He's the one who would know.

377
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:54,655
So you think a cop should
just stop what they're doing

378
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,720
as soon as a criminal tells
them they didn't do it?

379
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,916
Oh, my God!
That is actually a really good point.

380
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:01,019
So I only had one passenger

381
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,091
after you, and he got off here.

382
00:12:02,115 --> 00:12:03,915
- Well, what did he look like?
- I don't know.

383
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,191
I mean, he was wearing some dumb hat.

384
00:12:05,215 --> 00:12:06,607
I'm sorry, I know that's not helpful...

385
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:07,801
BOTH: All hats are dumb.

386
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,129
Ha! [SNORTS]

387
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,980
What the hell? Is that your laugh?

388
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:13,247
Also, quit vibing, and
help me solve this.

389
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:15,271
Sorry, man. It's what
the universe wants.

390
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:17,296
Screw the universe. The
universe is a dick.

391
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,027
Maybe it fell out when
he got out of the car.

392
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:20,233
Wow, you are so smart.

393
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:22,491
Oh, oh, yep, yep, yep. Here it is.

394
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,546
Uh-oh. It's kind of dirty looking.

395
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,586
But, you know, that's why they
put it in a dry cleaning bag.

396
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,343
I'm sure everything inside is totally...

397
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,873
Nope. Soaked in urine.

398
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,823
Damn it, New York.

399
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:34,377
[SOFT LAUGH]

400
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:38,008
Kay, you've been staring at
your phone for 45 minutes.

401
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,067
- Just read the email.
- What if it's bad news?

402
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,298
Sir, do you know how many times

403
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:42,843
I've not gotten something that I wanted?

404
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:43,867
- How many?
- Zero.

405
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,346
Because I have a trick.

406
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:46,676
Whatever that email says,

407
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:49,106
you just act like that's
what you wanted all along.

408
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:50,731
Well, I can't fake it. I want this job.

409
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:52,453
For years, I've worked
nights and weekends.

410
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:53,710
I've sacrificed friendships.

411
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:56,493
I've jeopardized my
relationship with Kevin.

412
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,243
And now...

413
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:01,408
to find out if it was all in vain.

414
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:02,837
Yeah, let's not check it.

415
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,572
It feels like there's a lot on the line.

416
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:06,345
Agreed. Let's just grab Cheddar

417
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,469
and go to the wedding.

418
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,290
Where is he? Cheddar?

419
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:11,504
Cheddar!

420
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:14,582
- Cheddar the dog!
- [GASPS]

421
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:15,817
Oh, he ate the cake.

422
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:18,650
Oh, Cheddar, you furry little pig.

423
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,455
Okay, Amy.

424
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,611
I got through every room and
I cleared them very fast,

425
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:24,159
because I love you and
I want you to be happy,

426
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:25,338
even if it's with somebody else.

427
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:26,705
- Did that new tactic work?
- No.

428
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,206
You just called it a tactic.

429
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:29,697
Can we get in the venue or not?

430
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,380
Not quite yet. There's one more vent

431
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:33,201
we can't get into, and
our snake cam broke.

432
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,531
We got another one on the way.
It'll be here in about 6 hours.

433
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:37,149
What? No. We need it now.

434
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:38,601
- People are already here.
- I'm sorry.

435
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,953
The vent is very tight, and no one
on my team can get into it.

436
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:43,584
I've been doing a lot of Pilates
so I'm pretty huge at this point.

437
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,498
- I'm going in.
- What?

438
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:49,536
There's no hole too small for Charles
Boyle to squeeze himself into

439
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:51,307
- Come on...
- Look, this is all my fault.

440
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:52,677
I put the announcement in the paper

441
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:53,924
and ruined this day.

442
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:55,173
And now I'm gonna be the one to fix it.

443
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:56,363
Get ready, you two.

444
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:57,911
I'm about to save this...

445
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:00,203
Bomb! There's a bomb!

446
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:02,342
Damn it, Dario.
Why'd you say there was no bomb?

447
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,434
Because I wanted to kill Amy.

448
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,803
Then why did you call in the threat?

449
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:06,883
I didn't. My daughter
found my hidden room

450
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:08,256
and discovered some blueprints.

451
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,458
[SIGHS] Yes, fine, Teddy.
You were right.

452
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,916
Now can you please get
the bomb out of the vent

453
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,296
- and dispose of it somewhere?
- Honestly, I wish we could.

454
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,552
But it's too dangerous to move.

455
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:18,018
We have to diffuse it on site.
I have to evacuate this entire block.

456
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:20,132
- It's gonna take all night.
- Wait, so you're saying...

457
00:14:20,156 --> 00:14:22,312
Wedding's off. For real, it's over.

458
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:26,531
Jakey, what's this that I
hear that there's no rabbi?

459
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:27,812
Not now, Aunt Linda!

460
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:34,608
Okay, so we just finished
processing Moretti.

461
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:35,999
- Did you talk to our parents?
- Yeah.

462
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:37,288
They ended up having dinner together.

463
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:38,337
It sounded like they had fun.

464
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:39,854
Our dads only got in
one arm-wrestling match.

465
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:40,917
- Who won?
- Neither.

466
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:42,293
They both threw out their shoulders.

467
00:14:42,317 --> 00:14:44,081

1
00:00:00,937 --> 00:00:02,924
And so concludes this
year's Secret Santa drawing.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,226
Just a quick reminder of the rules:

3
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:05,994
$40 limit, no perishable items,

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:07,996
and no homemade
massage coupons, Hitchcock.

5
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:10,098
Fine, then everyone'll have
to pay full price for them.

6
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:13,068
Oh, Captain. I would
like a $40 gift card

7
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:15,370
to any restaurant that serves nachos.

8
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:17,205
- I don't have you, Peralta.
- Not only do I know

9
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:19,074
that you do indeed have me,
but I also know

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,142
- who everyone else has.
- That's not possible.

11
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:23,593
Perhaps not for an ordinary
man such as yourself, Jeffords.

12
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:27,248
But for the brilliant mind of
Detective Sherlock Peralta...

13
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:30,351
I legally changed my name...
it's quite simply...

14
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:31,550
elementary.

15
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:33,135
For, you see, Amy made a face

16
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:34,451
I only recognized from our bedroom,

17
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:35,901
which means that she has Captain Holt.

18
00:00:35,937 --> 00:00:37,352
Charles has Terry. His eyes keep

19
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:38,665
- shifting over to him.
- No, I don't.

20
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:40,234
Terry looked disgusted,
which means he has Hitchcock.

21
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,970
Rosa didn't draw a name,
nor did she put one in.

22
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:43,549
- She doesn't wanna participate.
- Never do.

23
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,950
Hitchcock moves his mouth when he reads

24
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:46,383
and he quite clearly said Charles.

25
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:47,915
- I did get Charles.
- Scully has Amy.

26
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:49,484
He's hold his paper name-side out.

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,080
- Oh, he's good.
- And I have Scully,

28
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:52,730
which means Captain Holt has me.

29
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:55,392
I'll be taking that gift card.
Daddy loves nachos.

30
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,454
Should we draw the names
again and leave Jake out?

31
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,447
Yeah!

32
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:01,956
No! Sherlock wants a present!

33
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:21,309

34
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,616
Okay, quick update on the
Warren Street break-in.

35
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,038
Security cameras caught a picture

36
00:01:26,073 --> 00:01:27,440
of the suspect and guess what?

37
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:29,909
That's right. We got a hot perp alert.

38
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:32,010
Ooh!

39
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:33,546
- That's a handsome man.
- Mm, I'd like to

40
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:35,314
- bring that guy to justice.
- We all would.

41
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:37,114
But unfortunately, police cornered him

42
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,039
and he shot himself in the face.

43
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,618
All right. Thank you for that

44
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:42,440
shockingly dark update.

45
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:44,118
- Anything else?
- Uh, yes.

46
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:45,906
Something I'd like to say.

47
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:48,478
I'm a pretty private person
so this is kinda hard for me, but...

48
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:50,121
here we go.

49
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,097
I'm bi-sexual. All right.

50
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:55,099
I will now field one minute
and zero seconds

51
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:56,434
of questions pertaining to this.

52
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,139
- Go. Amy.
- How long have you known?

53
00:01:58,175 --> 00:01:59,853
Since seventh grade. I was
watching "Saved by the Bell"

54
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:01,914
and I thought, Zack Morris is hot.

55
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:05,142
And then I thought
Lisa Turtle, also hot.

56
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:06,577
The fact that the words
Kelly and Kapowski

57
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:08,279
didn't just come out of
your mouth is lunacy.

58
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:09,913
What made you decided to tell us now?

59
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,216
Charles found out on the road trip

60
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:12,583
and I was positive he was not

61
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:14,352
gonna be able to keep
the secret for much longer.

62
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:15,550
Bye Rosa.

63
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,489
I mean, not "bi," but bye!

64
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:20,224
I mean, see ya!

65
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:21,658
I mean, have fun only
having sex with men.

66
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:23,394
Just bangin' dudes, left and right.

67
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:24,962
I just stopped saying bye all together.

68
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:26,142
So are you seeing anyone now?

69
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:27,919
- Yeah. Her name's Tiffany.
- Are you lying about her name

70
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:29,454
- so we won't look her up?
- Yes, I am. Next.

71
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,856
- Do you know Anne Heche?
- I do.

72
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:32,492
- Ohh.
- I must say, this is going

73
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,664
considerably better than when
I came out to my colleagues.

74
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,139
They were not, as the kids say, awake.

75
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:38,541
- Do you mean woke?
- I did mean woke.

76
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,163
But it's grammatically incoherent.

77
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,590
Okay, we have time
for one more question.

78
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,676
- Oh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- Nope. Absolutely not. We're done.

79
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:46,787
Smart. It was not tasteful.

80
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:49,252
Is anyone else having trouble
with the Internet?

81
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,032
I've been trying to file
a warrant request

82
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:53,522
for 45 minutes and the stupid
server keeps timing out.

83
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:55,525
Nothing's loading. It's all pinwheels.

84
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,027
This all started when Cyber
Crimes moved in downstairs.

85
00:02:58,062 --> 00:03:00,293
I bet those jerks
are hogging our bandwidth.

86
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:01,840
Man, I miss the Sex Crimes Unit.

87
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,666
I know! They were so fun.

88
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,401
Remember their Christmas Party?

89
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,036
Okay, Sergeant Jeffords and I

90
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:08,199
will talk to Cyber.

91
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:10,072
Tell them I can't get on WebMD.

92
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,707
My nipple tripled in size
and I wanna know

93
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:14,401
- if it's good or bad.
- Can't believe that's good.

94
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:17,212
Hey. Was that weird earlier?

95
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,148
You mean when Charles showed
us those pictures of Nikolaj

96
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:20,549
taking a very sudsless bath?

97
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:22,151
Yes, it was uncomfortable.

98
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,685
No, I mean when I told
everyone I was bi.

99
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,088
- Was it too touchy-feely?
- Rosa, no. It was great.

100
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,057
And don't worry, just because
you opened up a little bit

101
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:29,760
doesn't mean everyone's
gonna be less afraid of you.

102
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:32,355
- We're all still terrified.
- Thanks, Jake.

103
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:34,496
- So how'd your parents take it?
- Uhh...

104
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:35,972
- I haven't told 'em yet.
- Really?

105
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,033
I mean, of course, you don't
have to but I just thought

106
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,401
you guys were getting closer
since prison.

107
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:41,170
No, I mean, we are. It's just,

108
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:42,615
I don't know how I would
say something like that.

109
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:44,350
Especially to my dad.
He's super traditional.

110
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:46,119
I'm afraid this would
just mess everything up.

111
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:47,862
We've been having so much fun lately.

112
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,564
- I don't wanna lose that.
- Okay.

113
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,633
Maybe just be honest with them. Right?

114
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,032
Tell 'em how you feel.
Like, you could say,

115
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,493
Mom, Dad, I'm bisexual.

116
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:07,328
But I'm still your daughter.

117
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:09,097
I'm still the same person
that I've always been.

118
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,250
And who I love will never change that.

119
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:15,169
And you guys raised me to
be strong and confident.

120
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,538
And I don't wanna hide who I am anymore.

121
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:20,441
I am bi.

122
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,310
Damn. That was...

123
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,578
And I know that this may come
as a shock to you,

124
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:25,379
but it's my truth.

125
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,115
So I hope you can accept that.

126
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,516
- Jake...
- Maybe you still see me

127
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:31,166
as your little girl, but I'm woman now.

128
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:33,488
And I know my own heart.

129
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:35,523
- You done?
- Yeah.

130
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,357
Wow, that felt amazing.
I really disappeared into it.

131
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:39,071
- Should I become an actor?
- Absolutely not.

132
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:40,704
- Copy that. All right. Good luck.
- Thanks.

133
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,367
Look, that guy's watching a video.

134
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:48,836
No buffering.

135
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,338
They got all the bars, Captain.
All the bars!

136
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:52,572
Keep it together, Jeffords.

137
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:54,508
Oh. You must be Raymond Holt.

138
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:56,432
Whoa. No. Germs.

139
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:01,314
We just wanted to ask
about the Internet.

140
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,216
Ever since you guys arrived,
things have gotten

141
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:05,580
- slow for us upstairs.
- We're the Cyber Crimes Unit.

142
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,045
Kinda need the bandwidth.

143
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:08,655
Do you guys even use
the Internet upstairs?

144
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,423
I thought you just write
down your hunches

145
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:11,926
in your notebooks with
your pens and paper.

146
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:13,316
I'll have you know you're
speaking to your Captain.

147
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:15,352
Well, I'll have you know
that we don't report to you.

148
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,630
We report to the Commissioner's
office. Ever heard of them?

149
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,005
I don't care who you report to,
this is what you're gonna do.

150
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,625
You're gonna, um...

151
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,504
- put the wires...
- Right.

152
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,814
Um...

153
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:28,707
- Terry.
- Uh... into the things.

154
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:31,377
And... and beef up the speeds. Got it?

155
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:33,579
We want beefy speeds!

156
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:35,881
Long story short, we remain un-beefed.

157
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,783
Unfortunately, we're out of options.

158
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:39,552
- They're just not scared of us.
- Right.

159
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:42,218
But there is one person
who scares everyone.

160
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:47,259
Hey! Captain Holt, Terry, Charles,

161
00:05:47,295 --> 00:05:50,134
I wanna say... Alan?

162
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,042
Close. It's Amy.

163
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,732
This is nice. I can't believe

164
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:54,832
- you're buying me dinner.
- Oh, well, you really

165
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:56,434
- helped me today.
- Did I?

166
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:57,602
I felt like I sorta straight-splained

167
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:58,703
how to come out to you.

168
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:00,071
No, it was good practice.

169
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:01,540
I think I'm ready to tell my parents.

170
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:02,966
That's awesome.
When are you gonna do it?

171
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:04,065
- In five minutes.
- What?

172
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,800
Actually, scratch that, they're here.

173
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:07,168
This is happening and I need
you to be here with me

174
00:06:07,204 --> 00:06:08,771
and also just step in and do it for me.

175
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,206
Rosa, I think that's a very bad idea.

176
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:11,341
And frankly, I'm not very comfortable...

177
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:13,865
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Diaz!

178
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:16,754
America's favorite couple!

179
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:19,618
I didn't know Jake was joining us.

180
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:22,131
Neither did I. What a fun
surprise that none of us

181
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,753
were remotely prepared for, Rosa, right?

182
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:26,082
- You seem nervous. Why?
- Uhh...

183
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:27,457
global warming.

184
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:28,825
What a bitch, right?

185
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:30,295
We all gon' drown.

186
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:31,863
Anyways, I'm gonna head to the bathroom

187
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:32,864
for the duration of one conversation.

188
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,907
No!

189
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,432
Uh, guys, I have something
I need to tell you.

190
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,767
- What is it, honey?
- Uhh, Jake, you take it.

191
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,536
Seriously? Me? Oh, man,

192
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:42,104
now I really do have
to go to the bathroom.

193
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,339
What, you didn't before? You lied?

194
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:45,565
You know, Oscar, most people
just ignore my nervous rambling.

195
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:46,567
Maybe shift focus back to Rosa.

196
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:47,657
Don't worry.

197
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:49,269
- We know what's happening.
- You do?

198
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:50,270
Of course.

199
00:06:50,438 --> 00:06:52,071
You and Jake are dating.

200
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,296
That's why you were nervous.

201
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:55,033
'Cause you know I never liked him.

202
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:57,153
What? Okay, first of all, that's insane.

203
00:06:57,188 --> 00:06:58,787
We've only met once
and we totally hit it off.

204
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:01,123
We talked about soccer,
I called it fútbol.

205
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,758
Oh, I see what happened. But secondly,

206
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:04,727
- Rosa and I are not...
- Denying that we're dating.

207
00:07:04,762 --> 00:07:06,462
Uh, you're right. We're a couple.

208
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:07,959
I love you, honey bun.

209
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,351
Uhh!

210
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,756
We need your help, Gina.

211
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:13,534
Gina, ugh, I haven't heard
that name in a long time.

212
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,103
- It's on your jacket.
- I know,

213
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:17,772
but no one says it out loud
and my baby can't read.

214
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:20,408
Which, I'm told is normal
for a ten-week-old, so...

215
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:22,744
- How's little Enigma doing?
- We call her Iggy now,

216
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:24,479
but you're gonna wanna keep it down

217
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:26,316
because she's trying to
take a nap, okay, Amy?

218
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:29,384
Oh, sure, I just feel like I
was matching the same volume

219
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,905
- that you were speaking at.
- Amy, keep it down.

220
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,654
Yes, yes, babies are adorable.

221
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,358
They're like we are but so much smaller.

222
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:39,060
So we're here because
we're having an issue

223
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,461
with the new Cyber Unit

224
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:41,662
that has moved into the second floor.

225
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:42,730
What happened to Sex Crimes?

226
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,266
They were so nice.

227
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,633
Remember their Christmas party?

228
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:47,067
Oh, so good.

229
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:48,669
- Ohh.
- But now Cyber's

230
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,605
hogging our Internet
and we can't get them to stop.

231
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,140
But you can intimidate anyone
into doing what you want.

232
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:54,809
No, sorry, I can't.

233
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:57,445
That's precinct business and, well,

234
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,824
I've left that life behind.

235
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,215
But your maternity leave
is over in two weeks.

236
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,851
Amy, volume, okay?

237
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:05,252
Volume!

238
00:08:07,223 --> 00:08:08,838
Hey, wait up.

239
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:10,240
Why'd you leave the table?

240
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:11,859
If we go to the bathroom
at the same time,

241
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:14,051
they're gonna think we're hooking up
since apparently we're dating now.

242
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:16,083
I'm sorry I said that. I thought I was

243
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,586
ready to do this, but I am not.

244
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:20,042
- I'm not gonna do it tonight, okay?
- Yes, of course.

245
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:21,735
Look, I support you no matter what.

246
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,603
Just do whatever feels right.

247
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,289
Can we just pretend
to be a couple for tonight?

248
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:26,606
And then I'll tell them in a
few weeks that we broke up.

249
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:28,976
Fine. But I have one rule.

250
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:30,844
- Hands off my butt.
- That's not gonna

251
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,446
- be a problem.
- Well, you say that now

252
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,449
but you're about to enter the Jake
Peralta boyfriend experience.

253
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:37,350
It can be quite intoxicating.

254
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,852
Hm. Also, you sat on a meatball.

255
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:41,588
Did I? Oh, man, these
are my Friday jeans.

256
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:43,490
Anyways, I'm gonna snap off a wiz

257
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:45,411
and I'll meet you back at the table.
Let's do this.

258
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:47,694
Guys, without Gina, we'll never be able

259
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:49,228
to bend Cyber to our will.

260
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:51,264
So we need to change tactics.

261
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:53,151
We need to woo them

262
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:56,456
with the international
language of friendship.

263
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:58,082
- Pork.
- Ohh.

264
00:08:58,118 --> 00:08:59,358
Ooh! I'll take it to them.

265
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:01,440
It's all dudes down there
and I'm not above

266
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:03,952
using a little flirtation
to get what I want.

267
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:06,971
- Was that a wink?
- You tell me.

268
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:09,715
I honestly don't know,
but you're all we got.

269
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:14,317
Hello, boys.

270
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,755
Oh, wait, wait... I
winked my contact out.

271
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,195
No, no, no. It's still there.

272
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,859
- Oh, God it's behind my eye!
- Fall back, Amy.

273
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,560
- Ohh...
- I got it, I got it.

274
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:26,230
Look, we got off
on the wrong foot this morning.

275
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,466
And I was hoping we could start fresh.

276
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,667
So we got you this.

277
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,638
Mmm. Decent.

278
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,707
Great, now that you've
accepted our meat pile,

279
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,709
perhaps you'll help us
restore our internet.

280
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,210
Sure. I can definitely help with that.

281
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,414
- Mm.
- How many KBPSs are you looking for?

282
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:44,995
- Many.
- Yeah, that's not an answer.

283
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:46,714
I need an exact number.

284
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,886
100.

285
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,621
Too few? Too many?

286
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,490
- Four.
- Okay, bro, I'll give you

287
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,726
four kilobytes of Internet.

288
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,495
You're making a fool of yourself.

289
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,711
No! You're the fool!

290
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:00,954
Hey, little man.

291
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,690
- Why so teeny?
- I'm not teeny.

292
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,026
- I'm average size.
- What a sad brag.

293
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,163
I don't even know who you are.

294
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,665
But I know who you are, Devin.

295
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:10,668
You tell everyone
you got a degree from Stanford

296
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:13,542
but you really went to Stamforb,

297
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,845
an online college based in Arkansas.

298
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,514
It's a good school.

299
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,275
You live with your aunt. That's sad.

300
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:22,045
And you spend a third of
your salary on tropical fish

301
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:23,681
and aquaria.

302
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:25,316
You know, I found all this off of, hm,

303
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:28,253
20 minutes of idle snoopin' around.

304
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:31,656
Imagine what I could do with a
dedicated couple of hours.

305
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:33,358
- What do you want?
- I want you to give

306
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:35,326
the Internet back to my friends.

307
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:38,764
Mm-kay? Or I'll keep diggin' and diggin'

308
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,100
and diggin' and diggin'.

309
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:43,336
Fine! I'll give you back
your Internet, okay?

310
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:45,532
- Just... we're through.
- Oh!

311
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:47,468
And maybe your co-workers
would like to know

312
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:50,304
what happened on your 7th grade
field trip to D.C.

313
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,740
- You monster.
- He pooped in the Reflecting Pool.

314
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:57,787
So how did you two finally get together

315
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,822
after all these years?

316
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,439
Oh, uh, you know,

317
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:02,474
I've just been crazy about her forever

318
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,677
and then one day I picked up
my battered old guitar

319
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:06,211
and I sang her a song.

320
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,780
Ohh!

321
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:09,949
- How did it go?
- Oh, you don't wanna hear it.

322
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:11,117
- Yeah.
- Yes, I do!

323
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,314
Well, I don't have my guitar here.

324
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,149
- Sing the song.
- ♪ Rosa, Rosa, Rosa, Rosa ♪

325
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:15,451
♪ Rosa, Rosa, Rosa, Rosa,
Diaz, Diaz, Diaz, Diaz ♪

326
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:16,586
♪ Diaz, Diaz, Diaz, Diaz ♪

327
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:17,721
♪ Rosa Diaz, Rosa Diaz ♪

328
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:19,190
♪ Diaz Rosa, Riza Diaz ♪

329
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:22,528
♪ Diaz, you are so cool ♪

330
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:23,829
Sounds better with a guitar.

331
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:26,265
Oh!

332
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,367
- Just put that away.
- What was that in the picture?

333
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:30,001
- Just my mom.
- Kinda looked like

334
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:32,003
- your co-worker Amy.
- Jake and Amy are friends.

335
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,972
- It's not weird.
- He had his arm around her

336
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:35,941
and she was showing off a ring.

337
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:37,309
Wow, you got a really
good look at that picture, huh?

338
00:11:37,344 --> 00:11:38,655
What's going on?

339
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:42,094
Jake and Amy are engaged.

340
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:48,155
- That's okay.
- What?

341
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,489
We understand. Love is complicated.

342
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:51,856
Wait, why would you be okay with that?

343
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:53,959
Mijita, when you called this dinner,

344
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:55,994
you were so nervous, we were worried

345
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,879
you were gonna tell us you were gay.

346
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,856
So you would rather me be

347
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:03,641
some dude's mistress than be in

348
00:12:03,677 --> 00:12:05,767
a loving relationship with a woman?

349
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:11,275
Well, Jake and I aren't dating.

350
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:12,410
But guess what?

351
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:13,979
Your worst fears are real.

352
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:15,947
I'm not straight. I'm bisexual.

353
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:18,016
And I don't care what
you think about it.

354
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:19,830
Screw this. I'm outta here.

355
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,323
I'm also gonna go.
Are you guys on Venmo?

356
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:26,758
You know what?
We'll figure it out later.

357
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:28,471
This isn't the right time. All right.

358
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:37,074
Hey, so, I ran after you last night,

359
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:38,743
- but I lost you in the subway.
- I took a cab home.

360
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:41,612
Really? Well, then, I definitely
terrified some random lady.

361
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:43,681
Hey, look, I'm sorry things didn't go

362
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:45,349
how you wanted with your parents.

363
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:47,084
- It was fine.
- Rosa, you don't

364
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:49,186
- have to say that.
- No, it really did go fine.

365
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:50,721
They texted me last night.

366
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:52,655
"Don't worry about dinner.
See you at game night."

367
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:55,225
Nice. But very surprising.

368
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:56,726
It's great. I told them I'm bi,

369
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:58,123
and they still invited me to game night.

370
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,232
They're clearly okay with it.

371
00:12:59,268 --> 00:13:00,753
Well, I'm just glad it worked out.

372
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:02,265
- Enjoy game night.
- Actually, they want

373
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,699
you to come to make up for

374
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:04,733
- how awkward dinner was.
- Oh, fantastic.

375
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,069
I'm still involved.

376
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:08,104
Well, I'm sure your dad
is a super chill guy

377
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:10,039
- to play against.
- He is not.

378
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:11,574
Well, then, let's hope I'm on his team.

379
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:13,276
- That is worse.
- Cool. So no good options.

380
00:13:13,311 --> 00:13:15,121
Super stoked about this invite.

381
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,288
Here we go.

382
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:19,351
It's loading!

383
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:20,463
We got Internet!

384
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,551
All right, I guess my work
here is done, guys,

385
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:23,819
How can we ever thank you?

386
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,254
I'll tell you how.

387
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,122
Use this precious Internet.

388
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:28,591
Use it every day.

389
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:30,292
Keep multiple tabs open,

390
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:31,827
stream videos in HD,

391
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:34,730
leave comments on
everything you can find.

392
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:36,398
Most importantly,

393
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,567
make your avatars GIFs.

394
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:40,435
I was thinking more like a pizza party

395
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:41,804
when you come back in two weeks.

396
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,106
Oh, yeah. So here's the thing:

397
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:45,474
- I'm not coming back.
- What?

398
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,242
- Seriously?
- Yeah, listen,

399
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:49,077
I have a daughter now
and when she grows up

400
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:50,646
I wanna be doing something
that makes her proud.

401
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,481
So I'm starting my own company.

402
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:54,682
- Ooh! What is it?
- I'm running a sports league

403
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:56,250
for other people's pets.

404
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,219
- Ohh.
- Well, Gina,

405
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,523
as your colleague, best friend,
brother and ex-lover...

406
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,625
- Ugh.
- I fully support your dreams,

407
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,426
but do you really wanna leave?

408
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:08,696
My mind is made up. And so...

409
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:12,166
this is Gina Linetti's last grand exit

410
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:13,334
from the Nine-Nine.

411
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:16,771
♪ I will remember you ♪

412
00:14:16,806 --> 00:14:18,285
Where's that coming from?

413
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,874
- She's gone.
- Do you think

414
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,543
that's the last time we'll ever see her?

415
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,880
Bye, Gina.

416
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:31,284
I don't know what that is.

417
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,419
That could literally be anything.

418
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,420
Maybe try guessing.

419
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,655
Rule violation!

420
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,856
You're not supposed to speak.

421
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:37,524
There's our turn, once again.

422
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,892
Oh, well, do you want me to tell you

423
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,174
what I was drawing just for fun?

424
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,943
We're not playing just for fun.

425
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:43,830
Mm-kay, well, don't let
my desire to have fun

426
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:46,600
ruin what seems to be
a very nice night so far.

427
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,568
- Right, Rosa?
- Yeah, right.

428
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:50,269
So your mother and I talked

429
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:51,771
about what you told us last night.

430
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:53,372
We don't need to talk
about that right now.

431
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:54,506
We want you to know we're not upset.

432
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:55,831
Great. I'm not upset either.

433
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,777
Because no matter
what you call yourself,

434
00:14:57,812 --> 00:14:59,211
you still like men.

435
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:00,846
So you can still get married

436
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:02,481
- and have a child.
- I can do those things

437
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:03,783
with either a man or a woman.

438
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:05,451
Yes, but it will be a man

439
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:08,387
because this is just a phase.

440
00:15:08,422 --> 00:15:10,522
Okay, that's settled. Ladies up.

441
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:16,696
So, since you're not coming back,

442
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:18,931
we wanted to bring you all your stuff.

443
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:22,301
It's a lot of gum and what seem to be

444
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:24,503
blackmail files you've been
keeping on all of us?

445
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:26,271
I'm not a blackmailer.

446
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:28,540
If you tell anyone I am,
I will release your secrets.

447
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:30,442
Look, we know you want
your daughter to be proud

448
00:15:30,478 --> 00:15:31,677
of the work that you do.

449
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,745
I just hope you know how important
you've been to the Nine-Nine.

450
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:36,582
Yeah, just today, I was able to
pull a warrant and arrest the guy

451
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:38,183
I've been tracking for three months

452
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:39,684
because you got the internet back.

453
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,253
You're indispensible

454
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,255
and we're really gonna miss you.

455
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,491
And I loved the Nine-Nine, you guys.

456
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:46,958
It just feels like it's time for me

457
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:49,261
to, like, build something of my own.

458
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:51,430
Like my entrepreneurial idols,

459
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,230
Oprah Winfrey, Lex Luthor...

460
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:54,328
The Superman villain?

461
00:15:54,364 --> 00:15:55,933
He built an empire, didn't he?

462
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:58,569
- Yeah.
- Well, we wish you luck.

463
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:00,538
And it's not gonna
be the same without you.

464
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,834
Mm, thanks for saying that, and...

465
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:04,937
I don't know, uh...

466
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:06,253
You know what?

467
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:08,383
You can have your blackmail files back.

468
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:09,881
I don't want 'em anymore.

469
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,516
Gina, these are just photos of me

470
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,217
in my everyday clothes.

471
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:15,207
- I know. It's painful, right?
- All right.

472
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:17,222
<i>- Your turn, mija.</i>
- Right.

473
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:28,566
Uhh, a woman.

474
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,432
Uhh, uh, lady.

475
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,836
Uhh, women. Two women.

476
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:35,873
Holding hands, uh, friends.

477
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:38,642
Ohh, mm, uhh... sisters!

478
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:39,710
Ooh! Business partners.

479
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:41,779
Uh, um, ooh, oh, oh,

480
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:43,580
co-owners of a chocolate shop!

481
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:46,416
Oh, love. Love... what do women love?

482
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:47,785
The... George Clooney!

483
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,486
It's a wedding!

484
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:51,225
They're brides. They're in love.

485
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:53,657
Mom, Dad, I know you don't
wanna talk about this

486
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,325
but I do.

487
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,493
I might get married to a man...

488
00:16:56,528 --> 00:16:57,661
like you so clearly want...

489
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,029
and I might not.

490
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:00,698
'Cause this is not a phase.

491
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,415
And I need you to understand that.

492
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,335
- I'm bisexual.
- There's no such thing

493
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,536
as being bisexual.

494
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:07,800
Yes, there is.

495
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:10,267
I know there is because that's who I am.

496
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,853
I'm attracted to both men and women.

497
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:14,844
I've known this about myself
for a really long time,

498
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:16,680
and I didn't wanna tell you
because I was afraid

499
00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:18,826
you were gonna react
exactly like you are.

500
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:21,875
What do you want us to say?

501
00:17:23,436 --> 00:17:24,975
That you accept me for who I am.

502
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:31,727
Wow.

503
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:35,019
Okay, let's go.

504
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:44,305
Hey. Got you coffee.

505
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:45,673
I don't drink coffee. Just herbal tea.

506
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,509
Oh. That's cool.

507
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:49,505
It only cost me, like, 18 bucks.
Brooklyn is a nightmare.

508
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,287
Hey, man, thanks for
being there last night.

509
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:52,323
Of course.

510
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,282
Sorry again about how it all went down.

511
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:55,617
Well, I'm glad I opened up to them,

512
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:57,066
even if it didn't change their minds.

513
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:59,159
I finally said what I wanted to say.

514
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:01,017
- It felt right.
- Yeah.

515
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:02,790
Still sucks, though.

516
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:04,125
Still sucks.

517
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,793
That's weird. My dad's here.

518
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:08,595
Hey, do you mind staying out here

519
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:11,398
- with me to talk to him?
- Um, yes, of course.

520
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:12,766
Whatever you need.

521
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,301
Your face. No, man, you've done enough.

522
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:15,602
- Get out of here.
- Oh, thank God.

523
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:16,991
Good luck.

524
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:19,470
Hello.

525
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,767
What are you doing here?

526
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:23,522
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

527
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:25,940
I reacted poorly last night.

528
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:28,322
- This is all new to me.
- I know.

529
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:31,553
But it's also not new, you know.

530
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,554
I'm still the same person I always was.

531
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:35,388
Well, I don't feel I know that person.

532
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:37,590
- Dad...
- My fault, not yours.

533
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,359
I want you to be able
to tell me everything.

534
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:42,637
I can't promise you I'll understand.

535
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:45,231
But I'm trying. I want you to know

536
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,633
that I accept you for who you are.

537
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,232
And I love you very, very much.

538
00:18:52,402 --> 00:18:53,839
I love you, too.

539
00:18:58,313 --> 00:19:01,781
So have you been
on any dates with women, yet?

540
00:19:01,817 --> 00:19:03,416
Dad, we didn't talk about
my dating life before,

541
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:04,951
we don't need to talk about it now.

542
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:07,486
Yeah, good, good. You're right.

543
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,711
So where's Mom?

544
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:11,509
Mm... Mom needs a little more time.

545
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,040
Oof.

546
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,436
I guess family game night's
gonna be kinda weird.

547
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:17,963
You know what, mijita, maybe we better

548
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:20,397
put game night on hold
for a little while.

549
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,268
- Okay.
- I'm gonna let you

550
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:24,783
get back to work, okay?

551
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,676
I expect certain things
from my assistant.

552
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,446
Black ink only. No blue.
I'm not a street artist.

553
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:36,281
Also, if you must knock on my door,

554
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:37,982
limit yourself to two raps.

555
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:40,317
If I wanted to hear inane pounding,

556
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,920
- I could go see "Stomp."
- He could go see "Stomp."

557
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:44,655
- Gina.
- Who's this noob?

558
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,390
We had to hire someone
to replace you, Gina,

559
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:47,792
- because you quit.
- Well, fire him.

560
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:49,460
'Cause I'm back, baby!

561
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:51,328
- Really?
- What changed your mind?

562
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:52,930
Was is the speech that Charles
and I gave you?

563
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:54,665
No. Captain Holt said

564
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,667
he'd give me a 5% raise if I came back

565
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:58,602
and he's letting me sit at my desk

566
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:00,638
and work on my side business
one day a week.

567
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:02,239
We never had that conversation.

568
00:20:02,274 --> 00:20:03,959
We just did, baby.

569
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:05,695
See ya, man bangs.

570
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:08,245
Come, Brent, let's get you down to HR

571
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,846
before that start
paperwork goes through.

572
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:12,983
- Welcome back, Linetti.
- Thanks, man.

573
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:14,417
Ugh!

574
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:15,752
All right, look, Gina, come on.

575
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:17,520
It's just us now. Admit it.

576
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:18,721
Amy and I changed your mind.

577
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:20,456
All right, it was you guys.

578
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:21,825
I actually even cried a little bit

579
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,459
after you left my apartment.

580
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:25,261
- Aw.
- Oh! I made Gina Linetti cry?

581
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:26,962
Hey, calm down.
I had a baby ten weeks ago.

582
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:29,631
I cried to a carpet cleaner
commercial yesterday.

583
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,532
Gina! Welcome back.

584
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,434
It's great to see you.
Hey, what's everybody

585
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:34,836
- doing tonight?
- Nothin'. Why?

586
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:36,337
There's something we all need to do.

587
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,607
- What's going on?
- Family game night!

588
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,876
Don't worry, I brought "Twister."

589
00:20:41,912 --> 00:20:43,611
- Hey.
- Hey, Rosa.

590
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:45,479
- Hey, Rosa. Beer.
- Here goes the snacks.

591
00:20:45,515 --> 00:20:47,415
Ehh, you know, in another lifetime,

592
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,350
you and I would've made
a hot ass couple.

593
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:50,815
Agreed.

594
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:54,555
Diaz, you should be
very proud of yourself.

595
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,624
I know things aren't exactly
where you wanna be right now,

596
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:59,410
but, uh, I promise you
they will improve.

597
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:00,894
- Thank you, Captain.
- Every time

598
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,702
someone steps up and says who they are,

599
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:06,152
the world becomes a better,
more interesting place.

600
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:07,370
So...

601
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:09,346
thank you.

602
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:14,441
Hey, do you seriously
only have two wine glasses?

603
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:16,043
- Yeah. I live alone.
- Well, you're gonna need

604
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:17,610
to get some more, 'cause
there's a lot of us here.

605
00:21:17,646 --> 00:21:19,079
Thank you for doing this, man.

606
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:21,014
Of course. We'll be here every week.

607
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,783
Rosa, I broke both your wine
glasses and your fridge door

608
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:25,018
and your bathroom.

609
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:27,487
Every single week!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

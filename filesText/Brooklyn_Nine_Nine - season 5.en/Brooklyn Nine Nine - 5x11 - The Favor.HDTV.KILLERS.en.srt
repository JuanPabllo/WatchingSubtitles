1
00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:02,964
Thank you, Margaret.

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:04,532
You're welcome, Raymond.

3
00:00:06,102 --> 00:00:07,902
- Seamus Murphy.
- That's right.

4
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:10,238
Remember how I saved
your detectives from prison

5
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:11,439
in exchange for a favor?

6
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:13,174
- The time has come...
- Wait.

7
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:14,876
- This isn't my order.
- What?

8
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,771
This is an omelet.
I only eat omelets on vacation.

9
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:17,929
Yeah, I don't care what you eat.

10
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:20,131
I'm here to call in the
favor that you owe me.

11
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:23,104
Really? What if I say no?

12
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,219
This is you asking me for intel

13
00:00:25,254 --> 00:00:26,954
and promising to pay me back.

14
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:28,622
How do you think this would
look to your bosses,

15
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:30,953
especially now that you're up
for the commissioner job?

16
00:00:31,293 --> 00:00:33,494
Yeah. I know everything.

17
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:34,862
So...

18
00:00:34,897 --> 00:00:36,063
what do you want from me?

19
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,601
A permit to throw a block party?

20
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:42,338
We don't even have to break the law.

21
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:43,807
This is fantastic news.

22
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:45,688
I am not giving Seamus Murphy
that permit.

23
00:00:45,723 --> 00:00:47,074
He only wants to use the block party

24
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:48,476
as a cover for something criminal:

25
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,978
a robbery, a murder, or something worse.

26
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:52,980
You don't know that for sure,
and that's your loophole.

27
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:55,382
- I don't believe in loopholes.
- What? Loopholes are the best.

28
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,317
Remember that time when
Pancake Palace had

29
00:00:57,352 --> 00:00:58,911
that all-you-can-eat deal, but
they didn't set a time limit?

30
00:00:58,946 --> 00:01:01,588
I ate pancakes for a week for $3.99.

31
00:01:01,623 --> 00:01:03,857
All I had to do was sleep there
and never shower.

32
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:05,859
What? Thanks for the invite, friend.

33
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:07,610
I will not be using a loophole, Peralta.

34
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:09,329
As always, I'll be using the main hole

35
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:11,365
or no hole. I choose no hole.

36
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,133
You just said "hole" way too much, sir.

37
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:14,902
And that's coming from Charles.

38
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:16,169
Yes, that's concerning.

39
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:18,005
Ugh, you think you know someone, Jake.

40
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,039
Unbelievable!

41
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:37,482

42
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:41,227
Captain, we think we found a way for you

43
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:43,062
to do Murphy the favor
and still live with yourself.

44
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:44,638
Sounds like a loophole.

45
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:47,265
Nope, we found the main hole,
and it is open for business.

46
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,267
- Oh, gross.
- Yep, sorry. Look.

47
00:01:49,302 --> 00:01:50,902
You don't want to give Murphy the permit

48
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:52,304
because you're afraid he's
gonna use it as a cover

49
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:54,172
for something illegal,
but what if we figured out

50
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:56,670
what he was up to and could
stop him before he did it?

51
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:58,609
That way you could give him a
permit with a clean conscience.

52
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:00,378
Well, how are you gonna
find out what his real plan is?

53
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:02,447
He's smart, and he doesn't talk
to anyone but his family.

54
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:04,849
I was worried about that, too,
but that's when I remembered:

55
00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:06,132
"The Godfather."

56
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,501
The Diane Keaton movie.

57
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:10,220
No one refers to it as that,
but Charles is right, she is in it.

58
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,956
This isn't one of your
movie plans, is it?

59
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:13,825
First of all, if we had
developed a "Minority Report"

60
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,526
style pre-crime division
like I suggested,

61
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,462
we wouldn't be in this Seamus
mess, and it's not just because

62
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:19,297
I wanted to go like this,
although I did.

63
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:21,098
But secondly, in "The Godfather,"

64
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,000
Don Corleone had three sons:
Michael, his favorite...

65
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:24,486
- Diane Keaton's husband.
- Mm-kay.

66
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:25,688
Then there was Sonny, the hothead.

67
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:26,890
Diane Keaton's brother-in-law.

68
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:28,266
Charles, you're being distracting.

69
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:30,168
No, he's not, he's actually
helping me to follow this.

70
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:32,042
Continue going through
Diane Keaton's relatives.

71
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:35,112
Fine, Diane Keaton's
other brother-in-law is Fredo,

72
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:36,701
the screw-up, the weak link.

73
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:38,915
And you think the Murphys have a Fredo?

74
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,317
Every family does, and in this family,

75
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:41,618
his name is Kyle.

76
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:43,120
- Is he on a roller coaster?
- Yes.

77
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:44,900
It's his driver's license photo somehow.

78
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:46,570
He's never had a job, he took six years

79
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:49,093
to graduate high school,
and his father paid $200,000

80
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,161
so he could attend
the University of Arizona.

81
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:52,596
Lake Havasu campus.

82
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,834
Sir, this kid is a disaster.

83
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:56,200
If there's anyone
that's gonna give us info

84
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:58,168
on the Murphy family
and slip up, it's Kyle.

85
00:02:58,392 --> 00:03:00,559
Okay, but if you don't
figure out what his plan is,

86
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:02,428
I don't give him that permit.

87
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:03,473
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

88
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:05,174
All right, go make contact

89
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,176
with Diane Keaton's brother-in-law.

90
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,577
Fredo. It's Fredo.

91
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:09,912
It's one of the most popular
movies of all time.

92
00:03:09,947 --> 00:03:11,709
Won best picture, so.

93
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,050
Ready for a kick-ass assignment?

94
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:15,151
Hell yeah.

95
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:19,422
Let's do this.

96
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:21,492
Wait, what do you mean by "kick-ass"?

97
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:22,958
Holt wants us to get
that block party permit.

98
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:24,500
Damn it.

99
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:26,069
I guess I'll take the knife
out of my pants.

100
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:27,930
No, come on, Rosa. It'll be so cool.

101
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,446
We get to go to SAPO,

102
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:31,182
the Street Activity Permit Office.

103
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:33,969
It is the oldest continuously
operating permit office

104
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,170
in the state.

105
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:36,438
Pass. Find somebody else.

106
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:37,973
But we promised to help Captain Holt.

107
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:39,174
Look, it'll be quick.

108
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,309
We'll just go, get Murphy his permit,

109
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:43,710
and maybe grab a few shots
for the 'Gram.

110
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:46,916
They have the original permits
for the 1939 World's Fair.

111
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:48,050
- No.
- Yes!

112
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:49,518
- No.
- Yes!

113
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:51,053
No, I mean,
"No, I don't want to do this."

114
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:53,087
No, yeah, come on. We're gonna do it.

115
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,223
Hey, Gina. How's it feel to be back?

116
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:58,259
- Any trouble adjusting?
- Adjusting to what?

117
00:03:58,294 --> 00:03:59,960
To life as a working mom.

118
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:01,529
You have to juggle the baby,

119
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:03,064
the job, your new business.

120
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:05,032
Terry, juggling isn't hard.

121
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,734
That's why the salary
for jugglers is so low.

122
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,570
Name one rich juggler.

123
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:10,704
Doesn't Dave Coulier juggle?

124
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,473
If you're reaching for Coulier,

125
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:14,308
then you've already
lost the argument, Terr-Bear.

126
00:04:14,343 --> 00:04:16,043
But there is one thing:

127
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:17,811
I need a private place where I can pump.

128
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:19,746
I was thinking maybe
I could take this whole floor

129
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,715
and you guys could move down
to that place where we park.

130
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,916
The garage?

131
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:24,517
Sure, if you think that works.

132
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:26,620
Well, there's an empty office
behind records.

133
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:27,821
It's nice and quiet.

134
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:29,056
We can put in a comfy chair,

135
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,423
maybe a mini fridge.

136
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,325
Uh, that would be a no-go, Sarge.

137
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,700
- That's our nap room.
- She needs to pump.

138
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:35,368
- The room is hers.
- Whoa.

139
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:37,269
That escalated fast.

140
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:38,465
Okay.

141
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,633
There's our Fredo.

142
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:41,969
He comes in here every day
at noon, for some reason.

143
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:43,703
Hey, change the channel, dude.

144
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:44,804
"Finding Bigfoot" is starting.

145
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,124
All right, let's go over
our covers one more time.

146
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,575
We are small-time operators

147
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,776
that just moved here from Miami.

148
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:53,479
We piloted go-fast boats,
moving contraband to Cuba.

149
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:54,914
Where we slept with the same prostitute.

150
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:56,082
- No.
- And she said you were

151
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:57,549
- the best she ever had.
- Maybe.

152
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,118
And I should watch you to learn.

153
00:04:59,153 --> 00:05:00,786
Back to no... let's just
not talk about our sex lives.

154
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,287
All right, we've got a week,

155
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:03,723
so we can ease our way into this thing.

156
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:05,357
Let's not blow it
by engaging right away.

157
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,026
Oh, no. We made eye contact.

158
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:08,828
He's coming over here.
We're engaging right away.

159
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:10,604
Hey, what's going on?

160
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:12,464
I saw you guys staring at me.

161
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:13,898
What? No, no, no, no, no.

162
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:15,000
We were just looking
at the TV behind you.

163
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:16,435
We love "Finding Bigfoot."

164
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,836
- It's our favorite show.
- Yeah.

165
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:19,284
I mean, why haven't they
caught him yet, right?

166
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,072
Totally.

167
00:05:21,107 --> 00:05:22,774
I mean, he's so big.
You'd think it'd be easy.

168
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:24,409
- Yeah.
- Yes.

169
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:26,512
Oh, my God, I'm feeling
a real connection here.

170
00:05:26,547 --> 00:05:28,713
Should we hang out sometime,
or am I being crazy?

171
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:30,215
You're not being crazy, Kyle.

172
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:32,525
How do you know my name?

173
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:35,320
Because we're so connected.

174
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:37,022
Oh!

175
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:39,696
- Yes!
- What?

176
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,245
So, this is my pad.

177
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,480
TV room, recording studio

178
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:45,147
where I lay down my raps.

179
00:05:45,182 --> 00:05:47,684
And this is where the magic happens.

180
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:49,302
It's where I practice doing magic.

181
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:51,239
Oh, so literally, then.

182
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:52,889
- Love all the lamps.
- Thanks.

183
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:54,757
I accidentally ordered
100 lamps instead of one.

184
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:57,093
They only give you, like,
a six-month return window, so.

185
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:58,591
- You get it.
- Totally.

186
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:01,054
Man, this place is huge.
How do you afford it?

187
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:03,266
Do you have, like, a great job
or family money?

188
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:05,501
Yeah, lots of it, I'm part
of the Murphy crime family.

189
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:07,001
- Oh.
- Aw, damn it.

190
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:09,664
I am not supposed to say that.

191
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,235
We're not a crime family, okay?

192
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,975
- We're a cream family.
- Dude, it's fine.

193
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,145
Honestly, we're also
involved in... cream.

194
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,214
- Organized cream.
- Cool, cool.

195
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:21,750
Hey, just checking...
you guys mean crime, right?

196
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,686
- Yes.
- Okay, good, right, go on.

197
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,688
Well, we're actually looking
for some work right now.

198
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:27,589
We just got into town from Miami.

199
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:29,257
Where we didn't sleep
with the same prostitute.

200
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:32,027
Yes, anyways, do you think
your family needs any help?

201
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:33,963
- Any big jobs coming up?
- Uh, wouldn't know.

202
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:35,571
They don't tell me anything.
They're mad at me.

203
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:36,665
What? Why?

204
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,999
I used to drive for my uncle Seamus.

205
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:39,601
One day, he had this big
cream meeting...

206
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:41,002
We don't have to keep doing that.

207
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:42,704
Okay, cool. He was torturing some guy.

208
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,605
Anyway, I was waiting
in his favorite car,

209
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,073
a white 1980 Rolls-Royce,

210
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:47,842
but he was taking forever,

211
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:50,244
so I decided to go catch
a matinee of "Suicide Squad."

212
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,879
And he was pissed that you
drove off in the car?

213
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:53,681
No, obviously I left the Rolls there

214
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:54,882
with the keys in the ignition
in case he needed it,

215
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,654
but guess what happened?

216
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,585
- It got stolen.
- Oh, my God.

217
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,021
- How'd you guys know?
- We're just connected, Kyle.

218
00:07:01,056 --> 00:07:03,690
- Team Bigfoot.
- Team Bigfoot!

219
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:06,490
Anyway, they kicked me out of
the family business for good.

220
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:10,231
Apparently, I'm a "liability"
and "worthless" and "Kyle."

221
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:13,000
The last one is just my name,
but you should hear their tone.

222
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:15,602
So, you don't know about anything

223
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:16,871
that's going down at all?

224
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:18,572
No, but if you know anyone

225
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:20,107
who's looking to buy a lamp
for really cheap,

226
00:07:20,142 --> 00:07:21,541
I know a guy.

227
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:22,977
- Oh, Kyle.
- Yeah, that's it.

228
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:24,178
That's how they say it.

229
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:27,715
This is taking forever.

230
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,650
Can't you just forge the signatures?

231
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:31,607
I'm a notary, Rosa.

232
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:33,034
You can't say stuff like that around me.

233
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,613
I could lose my stamp over that.

234
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:37,290
I've never met anyone who cares
so much about stupid bureaucracy.

235
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:39,304
Bureaucracy is not stupid.

236
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:40,504
It's elegant.

237
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:42,931
It's a beautiful puzzle

238
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:44,488
waiting to be cracked.

239
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:47,701
Every rule, every form has its purpose.

240
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:49,603
It all fits together,

241
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:51,650
and when the puzzle is solved

242
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:53,640
and you take a step back
and see the big picture,

243
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:56,643
it's like staring into the face of God.

244
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:57,957
Hey.

245
00:07:57,992 --> 00:08:00,045
- We moved up a spot.
- Oh.

246
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,247
You seem like a real nerd.

247
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,850
Hello, Muriel.

248
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,385
Another day in paradise?

249
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,221
She actually means that.
Please don't be offended.

250
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,422
Great. What do you want?

251
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,091
To apply for a block party permit.

252
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:13,992
Here is form 1290.

253
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,228
Oh, wait, you trying to get
a permit for this Friday?

254
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,262
You would need...

255
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,964
1290-B expedited request

256
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,101
and a 1021-J adjustment waiver

257
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:25,337
and a sweet, sweet P-28-P supplemental.

258
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,372
Right. There's just one problem.

259
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,375
What? No. I did absolutely everything.

260
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,344
The 1021-J has to be submitted

261
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,112
with an approved 1290.

262
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:39,050
But I'm submitting the 1021-J
to get the 1290 approved.

263
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,319
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I guess it doesn't.

264
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,088
Okay. Okay, okay.

265
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,991
This is just a puzzle,
and I can figure it out.

266
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,127
To get an approved 1290,

267
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,162
I need an approved 1021-J,

268
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,498
which I can't get without
an approved 1290,

269
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,533
which I can't get
without an approved 1021-J,

270
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,535
which I can't get without
an approved 1290,

271
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,537
which I can't get
without an approved 1021-J,

272
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,205
which I can't get without
an approved 1290,

273
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,039
which I can't get
without an approved 1021-J...

274
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:04,841
Okay. She's in a loop.

275
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,443
You broke her brain.
I'm gonna take her out of here.

276
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:07,778
Which I can't get
without an approved 1290,

277
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,346
which I can't get without...

278
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:12,283
Sarge, Hitchcock and I just
uncovered something huge.

279
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,850
- You solved a crime?
- What?

280
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:15,552
That's insane, no.
It's about our nap room.

281
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:17,154
Guess how long Gina's been pumping for?

282
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,855
- I don't want to...
- The last hour.

283
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,123
Now, everyone knows Gina's using

284
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:21,558
a Nodella Harmony Breastpump

285
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:22,959
with 2-Phase Expression Technology

286
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:24,795
for faster milk expression.

287
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,430
You shouldn't know so much
about breastpumps, Hitchcock.

288
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,864
Well, you should know more about

289
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,266
what's going on in your precinct.

290
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,234
Given the Nodella's exceptional flow,

291
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,903
there's no way she needs to be pumping

292
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:34,470
more than 20 minutes a side.

293
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,406
Wow, you didn't even say "breast."

294
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:38,108
Yeah, because I'm not a child.

295
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:39,843
I need my afternoon nap.

296
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,812
Okay, what are you guys trying to say?

297
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:42,867
Come with us.

298
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:45,148
Where's Gina?

299
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:47,184
She just left the pump
running and disappeared.

300
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,333
- You got played so hard.
- You cuck.

301
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,256
So, did you make contact
with Murphy's weak link?

302
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,890
- Diane Keaton's brother-in-law?
- Yes.

303
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,459
We're real tight, but unfortunately,

304
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:58,394
he's such a weak link, his
family won't tell him anything.

305
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:00,062
So... that's it, then.

306
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:01,564
We have no idea what
Murphy's really up to?

307
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,266
I can't morally give him
that permit, so it's over.

308
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:06,001
Wait. We still have time.

309
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:08,070
Maybe there's a way to get Kyle
back in with his family.

310
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:09,572
Like, what if...

311
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,207
Ooh, Jake's wheels are turning.

312
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,508
Your brain baby is crowning.

313
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:14,109
Boyle, please. That's disgusting.

314
00:10:14,144 --> 00:10:16,111
No, it's helping.
I am having a brain baby.

315
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:18,179
- Then push, man, push.
- Breathe.

316
00:10:18,214 --> 00:10:19,448
You can do this.

317
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:21,450
- You are so strong.
- Ah, got it!

318
00:10:21,485 --> 00:10:23,485
Kyle's uncle cut him off
because of that stolen car,

319
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,086
right, but what if
we could find that car

320
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:26,609
and have Kyle give it back to him?

321
00:10:26,644 --> 00:10:28,256
Then all is forgiven.
Kyle's back in the family.

322
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,024
Right, but how do we find that car?

323
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:31,493
We just did a big sweep
of Brooklyn chop shops.

324
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:33,161
Maybe Seamus's car is one of them.

325
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:34,396
Maybe it's in the impound lot.

326
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:35,431
Yes.

327
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,435
Okay. Put in my password.

328
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:44,339
Yes, it's in the impound lot!

329
00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:45,439
My brain baby's a genius.

330
00:10:45,474 --> 00:10:47,041
It's a miracle.

331
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:48,587
Who's this lady we're meeting?

332
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:50,578
The source: Florence Tinj.

333
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:52,981
She ran the rules and regs
department for 30 years.

334
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:54,415
She wrote the forms.

335
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,418
She has touched every life in this city.

336
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:59,320
- Not mine.
- Yeah-huh.

337
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,489
Haven't you ever filled out
a mileage reimbursement form?

338
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:02,957
No, dude, I make you do those for me.

339
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:04,825
Right, I'm so grateful to you for that.

340
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,527
Anyway, she's the only person
that can figure this out.

341
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:08,196
She understands the bureaucracy

342
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:11,164
on a level that we mortals
can't even fathom.

343
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,258
Florence Tinj.

344
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:17,661
What?

345
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:20,473
Detectives Diaz and Santiago, NYPD,

346
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:22,009
and I just want to say...

347
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:24,978
Those cats are having sex.

348
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:25,990
Yeah.

349
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:27,547
Uh, can you explain these forms to us?

350
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:29,316
They seem logically flawed.

351
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:31,118
At first, I thought it was a mistake,

352
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:33,853
but then I thought, "There's
something deeper at play here."

353
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:34,955
No, it's a mistake.

354
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,056
- They don't work.
- What?

355
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:37,524
But you wouldn't design a form

356
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,159
that literally can't be filed.

357
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:40,994
Yeah, I would. I did it all the time,

358
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:43,863
mostly out of spite,
but also incompetence.

359
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:46,198
Plus, I just found out I'm dyslexic.

360
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,521
Okay. Thank you for your time.

361
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:49,639
Good luck with all your,
uh, hoarding, Florence.

362
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:52,572
Okay.

363
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:54,407
We're supposed to pick up Kyle
in a minute.

364
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:56,142
We can't just bring him
straight to his uncle's Rolls,

365
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:57,544
or it'll seem suspicious,
so we gotta figure out

366
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:58,978
a way to make him notice it on his own.

367
00:11:59,013 --> 00:12:00,212
What if you drive by and I yell,

368
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:01,815
"Those two birds are having sex!"

369
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,115
He'll obviously want to see that,

370
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,116
and when he looks, voilà.

371
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:05,485
The car's right there.

372
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,420
Or I could just drive by it very slowly.

373
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:09,555
- Ah, also a good plan.
- Okay, let's do it.

374
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,458
So, that's when it hits me:
savory dinner cereal.

375
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:15,094
- Oh, my God.
- What?

376
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:17,896
Instead of it being cold,
what if I heat it up?

377
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:19,298
Unless... is that just soup?

378
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,300
- It is.
- You know what?

379
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:22,935
I think I left my wallet at home.

380
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,191
- I'm just gonna turn around.
- Dude, look.

381
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:27,606
My favorite gamer
just uploaded a new vid,

382
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:28,941
and his mom is in this one.

383
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:32,610
Then Tom Cruise hang glides
in with a machine gun

384
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,846
and he's like, "This is my party now!"

385
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,516
Anyway, if I could make a movie,

386
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:40,118
that's how it would start.

387
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:42,220
Kyle, look, two birds are having sex!

388
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:44,322
What? Where? Aw, man, I missed it.

389
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:46,124
Well, let's just turn around again.

390
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,258
Where are those birds?

391
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:49,027
Still no humping birds. Damn it.

392
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,462
We're never gonna see those birds.

393
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:52,529
Look behind that 1980 white Rolls Royce.

394
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,998
Ugh, I wish that stupid car would move.

395
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:57,621
Kyle, isn't that your uncle's car?

396
00:12:57,656 --> 00:13:00,103
Oh, my God. Dude!

397
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,109
I did it.

398
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,349
I found it. I found my uncle's car.

399
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,943
Victory dance, whoo!

400
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:08,983
Oh, no, wait, stop!
Don't dance in the...

401
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,159
- Oh, Fredo.
- I think I got hit!

402
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:18,333
Ok, why are you barefoot?

403
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:20,335
I'm violating uniform conduct code 773

404
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,868
because the rules are pointless

405
00:13:22,904 --> 00:13:25,471
because they were written
by a hoarder who doesn't care.

406
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:27,474
Same here. Fight the power.

407
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:28,719
We can't give up now.

408
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:30,411
Not when Captain Holt's career
is on the line.

409
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:31,645
We have to get that permit.

410
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,681
How? The forms don't make any sense.

411
00:13:33,716 --> 00:13:36,308
- I mean, is anything even real?
- No.

412
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:38,018
Odds are we exist in a
computer simulation,

413
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:39,292
but I don't have time
to go down that rabbit hole.

414
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:41,455
Look, the fact that these forms
are broken is a good thing.

415
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,425
It means there are many mistakes.

416
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:45,759
- Mistakes we can exploit.
- That's right.

417
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:48,629
This is every form SAPO
has put out for 100 years.

418
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:50,330
We have to read every
single one and look for

419
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:52,328
miniscule mistakes that will
help us get that permit.

420
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,001
So you ready for a kick-ass assignment?

421
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:56,402
Hell yeah.

422
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:02,542
Let's do this.

423
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:05,645
Hey, why'd you want to meet out here?

424
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,947
Because we have a huge surprise for you.

425
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,915
- You found my birth mother?
- What? No.

426
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,517
The surprise isn't gonna
be as good as that...

427
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,052
I'm sorry I let you guess... but...

428
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:16,889
Yeah, after we dropped you
at the hospital,

429
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:18,523
we went back and stole it for you.

430
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,624
Now you can give it to your uncle.

431
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:20,890
Oh, my God.

432
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,776
He's gonna finally let
me back in the family.

433
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:23,963
Fabien, Marco,

434
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:25,664
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

435
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,832
Oh, don't worry about it.
It was nothing.

436
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,251
No, it was everything.

437
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:30,802
You guys believe in me,
and honestly, it saved my life.

438
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,671
Remember the other day at
the bar when we first met?

439
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,773
I was all alone and having
some pretty dark thoughts.

440
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,008
- Really?
- Yeah.

441
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,576
I was ready to just, uh, give up...

442
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,544
- Oh, no, Kyle.
- On my rap career.

443
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:40,912
Oh, went somewhere
different than I thought.

444
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,235
- I'm glad that you kept rapping?
- Thanks.

445
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:44,904
You're the two best dudes
I've ever known.

446
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,018
That's nice. And hey, guess what?

447
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,552
- You did find my birth mother.
- Nope.

448
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,854
I was gonna say you're a great guy, too,

449
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,422
but I'm sorry I keep teeing that up.

450
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,724
- But you're looking for her?
- Sure.

451
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,627
Oh, hello, Muriel.

452
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,763
Ugh. The block party girls.

453
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,899
Look, I told you, your forms don't work.

454
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,566
- You're not getting the permit.
- Right.

455
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,902
But we had a different permit in mind.

456
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,969
This is form 8, as in the eighth form

457
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:07,737
ever written for the city of New York.

458
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:10,040
Those old forms are all
out of circulation.

459
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,642
They should be, but
someone made a mistake,

460
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:15,379
and this one was never
officially decertified.

461
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,746
Which means it's still valid,

462
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,581
which means you have to process it.

463
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:19,950
"Street closure request

464
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,552
for the public humiliation
of loose women."

465
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,354
And, as you can see, you are required

466
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,958
to expedite processing for
the fee of one hay penny.

467
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,426
Keep the change.

468
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,062
Okay, but it says here that the form...

469
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,863
Must be submitted by a man.

470
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:35,732
I know. It's a huge bummer.

471
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,667
- But also...
- Hi, there.

472
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:39,402
I'd like to humiliate some hussies,

473
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:40,597
and I'm in a hurry.

474
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:48,377
Pumping hard or hardly pumping, Gina?

475
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:49,745
Where were you?

476
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,047
Uh, just so we're on the same page,

477
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:52,714
how long have you been here,

478
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:54,616
i.e., how elaborate
does my lie need to be?

479
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:56,018
- An hour.
- Okay.

480
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:57,954
The CIA contacted me,
and there's some...

481
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:01,490
Gina, you cannot use pumping
as an excuse to slack off.

482
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,997
- I wasn't slacking off.
- Well, you weren't here.

483
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,861
Man, I was trying to help you.

484
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:08,530
Ugh. I know. I'm sorry, I went home.

485
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:11,066
I was missing Iggy and
I wanted to see her.

486
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:13,601
Oh, well, you could've just told me.

487
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:15,403
Yeah, but I was embarrassed.

488
00:16:15,438 --> 00:16:17,738
I thought I'd be as incredible
at being a working mom

489
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:19,474
as I am at everything else I do:

490
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,844
dancing, public speaking,
capoeira, ghost hunting...

491
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,579
You don't have to keep
listing things you're good at.

492
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:27,282
Earring-making, cabinet renovation.

493
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,981
But juggling things is hard.

494
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:31,953
I feel like a failure.
I feel like a Coulier.

495
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:33,788
No, you're not a Coulier, Gina.

496
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:36,458
Look, being a working parent is hard.

497
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:38,093
When my twins were born, I made Sharon

498
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:40,795
keep the phone on all day
just so I could listen to them.

499
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,782
One month, I used 25,000 minutes.

500
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:46,333
I'm sorry.

501
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:48,827
I just realized I told you it
sucks and there's no solution.

502
00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:49,937
That's okay.

503
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:51,405
It's kind of nice to
hear this kind of thing

504
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,552
from another parent, so... thank you.

505
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:57,476
You know, I don't even think
Dave Coulier juggles.

506
00:16:57,512 --> 00:16:59,171
I Googled it. He doesn't.

507
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:01,553
Man... what a trip.

508
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:05,620
♪ Rap, rap, spitting rhymes ♪

509
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:07,989
♪ Kissing shorties on the lips ♪

510
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:10,357
<i>♪ Have no fear, Mr. Rap is here ♪</i>

511
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:11,958
<i>♪ And he will drink three beers ♪</i>

512
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:13,560
I wish he would turn the radio down.

513
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:14,928
You think that's the radio?

514
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:16,563
That sounds like
professional music to you?

515
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:19,365
All music after Mahler
sounds exactly like that.

516
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,368
Now, how do we expect Kyle
to transfer the bug to Seamus?

517
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:24,303
I got him a very expensive
bottle of whiskey

518
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:25,471
to give to his uncle as a gift.

519
00:17:25,506 --> 00:17:26,773
The transmitter's in the cork.

520
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:28,307
We planned for everything.

521
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:33,805
Oops.

522
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:35,475
- What was that?
- He broke the bottle.

523
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:36,649
He Fredo'd it.

524
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:38,050
Oh, so you didn't plan for everything?

525
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:39,818
You forgot to idiot-proof the bottle.

526
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:41,754
Well, perhaps you want
to idiot-proof your criticism,

527
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:44,322
because I got him a backup
bottle with a backup bug.

528
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:45,791
It's a good thing I had another one.

529
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:48,527
Oh, no. God!

530
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:50,362
And... there goes the backup bottle.

531
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:52,431
Right, except for one thing:

532
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:53,832
I also put a bug in the keys.

533
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,568
Of course he did.

534
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:57,469
Guy's got more bugs up his
sleeve than Oogie Boogie.

535
00:17:57,504 --> 00:17:58,938
- Don't get the reference.
- "Nightmare Before Christmas."

536
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:00,472
- Oh.
- Shh, shh, shh.

537
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:02,135
- They're talking.
<i>- Hey, Uncle Seamus.</i>

538
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:04,738
- These are for you.
- You found my Rolls.

539
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:06,444
I'm impressed.

540
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:09,747
Hey, welcome back to the family, huh?

541
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:11,384
<i>We got a lot of catching up to do.</i>

542
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,617
Well done.

543
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:13,851
Well done. Thank you both.

544
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,720
We did it. We reunited a family.

545
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:17,589
Is this what it feels like to be Oprah?

546
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:18,889
You wish.

547
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:25,262
OK, here's what we found out
from the bug that we placed.

548
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:27,500
Seamus is planning on stealing
$20 million in bearer bonds

549
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:28,770
from an armored truck.

550
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:31,068
As we speak, the block
party is in full swing.

551
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:32,603
Oh, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba. Here you go.

552
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:34,521
<i>Turns out, he only wanted a permit</i>

553
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:36,190
<i>so the street would be closed down,</i>

554
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:37,357
<i>forcing the armored truck to divert</i>

555
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:38,992
<i>down a narrow abandoned alley.</i>

556
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:40,460
<i>It's the perfect place for an ambush,</i>

557
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,096
<i>but we changed the truck's schedule,</i>

558
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:43,362
<i>so they hadn't picked up the bonds yet.</i>

559
00:18:43,397 --> 00:18:44,864
Hey, there's nothing in here.

560
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:46,265
That truck is as empty

561
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,865
as Jackson Browne's running surface.

562
00:18:49,978 --> 00:18:51,270
Empty? "Running on Empty"?

563
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:52,972
- He sings that song.
- Running surface?

564
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,440
Okay, so Terry didn't
like it... Charles?

565
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:56,142
- Don't make me do this, Jake.
- Whatever.

566
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,610
The point is, the truck is empty.

567
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:59,311
So we did it... I can't believe
it's all wrapped up.

568
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,013
- Do you even know what we did?
- No.

569
00:19:01,048 --> 00:19:02,882
Just feeling out how close
we were to calling it a day.

570
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,283
Soon, Scully. Now that Captain Holt

571
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:05,918
has repaid his debt without compromising

572
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:07,353
his stupid moral compass,
the only thing left

573
00:19:07,388 --> 00:19:08,955
is for him to get his tape back,

574
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,589
which should be happening
right about... now.

575
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:12,023
Oh.

576
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:13,424
Your block party's going well.

577
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,260
Wasn't as much fun
as I hoped it would be,

578
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:18,130
but, um, you lived up
to your end of the bargain, so.

579
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:20,132
- I'm a man of my word.
- As am I.

580
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,633
Your tape.

581
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,469
You ever want to do business again,
my door is always open.

582
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:27,433
Well, you should close it,
lest you get moths.

583
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:28,557
Good day.

584
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:31,203
_

585
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,320
Hey, there, sir.

586
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:33,492
Top of the mornin' to you.

587
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,029
Oh, no. What's wrong?

588
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:37,332
Why do you always assume something's
wrong when I come in here?

589
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:38,333
Couldn't I be bringing you good news?

590
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:39,400
- Are you?
- No.

591
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:40,776
Something's terribly wrong.

592
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,570
- It's Seamus.
- What do you mean?

593
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:44,338
Forensics confirmed
the tape he made of me

594
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:45,339
was never copied. We're in the clear.

595
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:46,674
It's not about that.

596
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:48,443
I was checking our bug,
and I overheard him

597
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,711
talking about what went wrong
with the armored car heist.

598
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:52,212
He's pinning the blame on...

599
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:54,615
Kyle. It has to be him.

600
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,417
Everything was going great
until he suddenly reappeared

601
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:57,685
out of the blue.

602
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,587
I bet that dum-dum ran his mouth,

603
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:02,201
and that is the last time
he screws over this family.

604
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,358
He's gonna pay.

605
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:06,193
Did he say what he would do to him?

606
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:08,162
No, they ran over a huge
pothole and then complained

607
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:10,064
about de Blasio for the next hour.

608
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:11,231
Yes, he needs to do something
about the roads.

609
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,499
Look, I don't specifically know

610
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:14,301
they're gonna do something bad to Kyle.

611
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:16,337
They might just lightly beat
him up, so we could do nothing.

612
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:18,772
- We could take the loophole.
- You do love loopholes.

613
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:20,937
I know we just put Seamus behind us,

614
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:24,526
but unfortunately,
you've made me a better person.

615
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,747
- I think we have to help Kyle.
- Good.

616
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,516
I'm proud of you.

617
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:32,552
Oh.

618
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,355
Sorry, it's just...

619
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,589
you said you're proud of me.
That's my tear trigger.

620
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:39,847
All right. Let's go save
Kyle before the dam breaks.

621
00:20:40,576 --> 00:20:42,501
_

622
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,833
- Hello, Seamus.
- Hello, Raymond.

623
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,070
So, apparently, NYPD police came today

624
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:54,640
to arrest my nephew Kyle
for unpaid parking violations.

625
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:57,176
And you want me to,
what, clear his record?

626
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:59,345
I've already done my favor.

627
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:00,412
No, I know it's a cover.

628
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:02,114
I know he's in protective custody

629
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:04,316
because he helped you
stop my armored car play.

630
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:06,118
I don't know what you're talking about.

631
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:07,653
- No?
- You asked me for a permit,

632
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:09,421
and I got it. I've paid my debt.

633
00:21:09,456 --> 00:21:11,056
Now, if you'll excuse me,

634
00:21:11,091 --> 00:21:12,491
I have a bowl of mush to enjoy.

635
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:15,093
You're right. You don't owe me anything.

636
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,729
But I owe you.

637
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,498
And what, exactly, does that mean?

638
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,497
That means you mess with my
family, I mess with yours.

639
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:26,050
You tell your husband, Kevin,
I'll see him real soon.

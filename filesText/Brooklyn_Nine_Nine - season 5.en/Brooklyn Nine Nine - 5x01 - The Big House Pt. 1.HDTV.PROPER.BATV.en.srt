1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,188
Just eating butter like
a popsicle, huh, Boyle?

2
00:00:05,227 --> 00:00:07,595
Yeah, I know, I'm spoiling myself,

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,531
but I'm depressed. Or
have you forgotten

4
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:11,499
that Jake, my best
friend, is in prison?

5
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,101
- Wait, Jake's in prison?
- Yeah!

6
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:15,603
He and Rosa were framed for
a bunch of bank robberies

7
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:16,838
by Lieutenant Hawkins.

8
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:18,940
Oh, right. And where's Gina?

9
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:21,176
On maternity leave! We were
all at her baby shower

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,677
- last week.
- Okay.

11
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:24,212
And why am I bleeding?

12
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:25,847
I don't know, Hitchcock.

13
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:27,682
Oh, so you don't have all the answers.

14
00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:29,217
I'm bleeding because my piece-of-crap

15
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:30,685
son-in-law bit me.

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,153
Look, we all miss Jake and Rosa,

17
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:33,855
which is why we have to
keep working the case.

18
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:35,690
There has to be some
way to exonerate them.

19
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,525
I've been looking, but
I can't find anything

20
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,294
- and I don't know what to do.
- "I can't find anything

21
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:41,029
and I don't know what to do":

22
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:43,831
- title of your sex tape.
- What is happening

23
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:45,133
- right now?!
- They caught Hawkins

24
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:46,301
trying to flee the country.

25
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:47,869
She confessed to everything,

26
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:49,637
- and they let me out.
- Oh, my God,

27
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,139
Jake, is it really you?
Are you really here?

28
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:52,707
You know it, baby.

29
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,043
But first... I gotta
hug my best friend.

30
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:56,077
- Yeah.
- What?

31
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:57,545
Welcome back, Peralta.

32
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,980
I just heard from the mayor.

33
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:00,515
To apologize for what happened to you,

34
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:01,716
they're sending you to Disney World.

35
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,185
You and one male guest.

36
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,588
As long as I don't have to go
on any of the scary rides.

37
00:01:06,622 --> 00:01:09,157
- I'd just go for the shows.
- Yeah!

38
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:11,559
Boyle, Boyle, Boyle!

39
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:13,595
Boyle, Boyle, Boyle!

40
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:14,896
Boyle!

41
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,264
Were you dreaming about Jake again?

42
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:17,832
Why did you wake me up?!

43
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:19,701
I told you never to wake me up!

44
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:22,704
- sync and corrections by Mr. C -
- www.addic7ed.com -

45
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:46,628
Wake up! Rise and shine!

46
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:51,633
Good morning, Caleb.

47
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,768
You woke up happy for once.

48
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:56,604
You're damn right I did.
It's visiting day.

49
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,608
It's visiting day!

50
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:02,076
Happy visiting day.

51
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:03,945
Happy visiting day, Tommy. You excited

52
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,214
for the family to come?
Tino, is Maria on her way?

53
00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:08,249
Miguel, happy visiting day...

54
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:10,952
And he hung himself. Oh, my God.

55
00:02:10,986 --> 00:02:13,121
Guard! Guard!

56
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:14,656
- Hi, hey.
- Hi.

57
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,225
Oh, man, three weeks is way too long

58
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:19,894
- between visits.
- I know, I'm so sorry.

59
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:21,729
It's been so hard to get down
to South Carolina between

60
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:23,931
work and spending every
free minute on your case.

61
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:25,833
All right, that's enough touching.

62
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:27,335
You used all
the touching time, Amy.

63
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:28,936
I get 100% of the
goodbye touching time.

64
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:30,905
- 100%.
- So, Charles, I gotta ask:

65
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,907
- what's going on with your hair?
- Well, it turned white

66
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:34,976
from the stress, but I
didn't want you to worry,

67
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,844
so I dyed it back to my normal color

68
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,314
with a splash of Batali.
Do you like it?

69
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:42,350
So, how's my case going?
Have you found anything

70
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:43,918
on Hawkins? I've been
working it in here.

71
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,186
You know, when no one's watching.

72
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,788
In my cell. At night. In the dark.

73
00:02:46,822 --> 00:02:48,156
I guess I've been mostly
thinking about it.

74
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,024
We're tracking her 24/7.

75
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:52,093
You know, watching her men,
combing her old files,

76
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:53,828
but she's done a great job
at covering her tracks.

77
00:02:53,862 --> 00:02:55,296
We will find something, babe.

78
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:57,665
I swear. Don't give up hope, okay?

79
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,033
How are they treating you?
Are you safe?

80
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:00,835
Yeah, I'm in protective custody

81
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:02,270
because everyone in gen pop hates cops.

82
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:03,771
I'm not really sure why.
Something about us

83
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:05,039
locking them in cages

84
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:06,207
and letting the world pass them by.

85
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:08,209
So, it sounds

86
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:09,944
like you're isolated and
haven't had any chance

87
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:11,779
- to make new friends.
- Well, my cellmate,

88
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:13,681
- Caleb, is okay.
- Just remember he's in prison.

89
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:15,850
No matter how small the
crime, people don't change

90
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:17,285
and don't deserve second chances.

91
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,654
Charles, relax. I'm not
gonna replace you.

92
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:21,022
Trust me, all I've been thinking about

93
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:22,390
is when you guys are
gonna get down here.

94
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:24,826
And now you are, and
we can finally talk.

95
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,294
There's an incident

96
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:28,129
in the yard. We're going into lockdown.

97
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,664
- Inmates, line up.
- No.

98
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:31,132
No, no, no, no, no.

99
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,800
I have 50 more minutes. I need this.

100
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:35,136
- Back to your cells right now.
- No!

101
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,804
My touching time.

102
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:42,176
Sarge, Captain. Oh, you
guys brought Hitchcock.

103
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:44,979
Uh, no, we just bumped
into him in the lobby.

104
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:47,315
- We don't know why he's here.
- Jenny, baby!

105
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,718
I love what prison's
doing to your figure.

106
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:56,691
Okay. So, how's prison?

107
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:58,326
Nobody likes cops in here, so
I had to earn their respect

108
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,261
by starting a bunch of riots.
Got thrown in solitary

109
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:02,363
for a week. What's going
on with your face?

110
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:04,832
I hate seeing you like this,
so I'm flexing my eyes

111
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:06,701
real hard to keep from crying.

112
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:08,903
It's okay, we can still
have a normal conversation.

113
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:10,905
So... how's the food?

114
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:14,275
Pay no attention to him, Rosa.
He's very emotional, Rosa.

115
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:16,177
Why are you saying my first name?

116
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,379
Well, Rosa, I read an article
in a medical journal

117
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:20,348
that said one destabilizing aspect

118
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:23,351
of incarceration is the
constant dehumanization,

119
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:25,086
Rosa. You need to be reminded

120
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,188
that you're more than
just a number, Rosa.

121
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:30,024
You are Rosa... Rosa.

122
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:32,026
- Yup, that fixes prison.
- Is there anything we can do

123
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,528
to help you? Anything you need done

124
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:35,263
- on the outside?
- No, I'm good.

125
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:36,798
- It's not a problem.
- Rosa.

126
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:38,099
- We're here for you.
- Rosa.

127
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:40,768
- Whatever you need.
- Rosa.

128
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:44,872
Okay, I'll come up with a list.

129
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:47,041
The alarm went off before
we could even talk.

130
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,743
Aw, that's too bad, bud.

131
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:50,111
But at least you have
people that wanna come

132
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:51,979
and visit you. My family hasn't been

133
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:54,549
to see my since my trial.
You eat nine people

134
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,950
and all of the sudden they "don't know

135
00:04:55,984 --> 00:04:57,418
who you are anymore."

136
00:04:57,453 --> 00:05:00,121
Wait... what?

137
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:03,291
Did you say "eat people"?
Are you a cannibal, Caleb?

138
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:05,893
Well, that's not how I
would define myself.

139
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:07,395
If we're going by what I'm
most passionate about,

140
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:09,063
I would say that I'm a woodworker.

141
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:11,065
Why did you think I was
in protective custody?

142
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,067
I don't know, I guess I
hoped you were another cop

143
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:14,902
wrongly convicted of
crimes you didn't commit.

144
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:17,238
Nope, I did all my stuff and more.

145
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:19,006
There's tons they can't
even trace to me.

146
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,808
The secret is eating the evidence.

147
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:23,144
Okay, this is just great.
I don't see anyone

148
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:24,846
from the outside for
another three weeks

149
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,247
and my only friend here is a cannibal.

150
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:28,249
Woodworker. Look, if you really wanna

151
00:05:28,283 --> 00:05:29,951
talk to people on the outside,

152
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,419
- just get a cell phone.
- Yeah, that'd be great,

153
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:33,087
- but it's illegal, right?
- There's this guy

154
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:35,256
in gen pop... Romero.
He can smuggle anything

155
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,925
into this place: phones, drugs,

156
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,927
- big bag of hair.
- Why would you want that?

157
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:41,429
You know what? Don't tell me.

158
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:42,830
The less I know about you, the better.

159
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:44,866
Okay, let's find this Romero guy.

160
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,434
Right now? I really wanna chomp down

161
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:48,503
- on this meat.
- Caleb...

162
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:50,371
This is scary.

163
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:51,973
I don't like being so near gen pop.

164
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:53,508
It's fine. It's not like they're

165
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:55,443
all waiting for an
opportunity to kill us.

166
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:57,011
I'm sure some of them
are actually nice,

167
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,846
like this gentle giant here.

168
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,448
Hello, sir, what brings
you to the fence today?

169
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:02,016
Just here to stab you
if you get too close.

170
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:05,820
Neat. Caleb, remind me

171
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:06,988
not to stand too close to the fence.

172
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:09,457
Will do. Oh, here's Romero.

173
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:11,225
So, what's up? You need
another bag of hair?

174
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,627
- Yeah.
- No.

175
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:14,328
We'll talk later. Same order, though.

176
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:15,963
I hear you're the man to talk to

177
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:17,899
- about getting a cell phone.
- I am.

178
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,001
But it'll cost you. Phone's 100.

179
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:22,236
- $100? That's no problem.
- I got no use

180
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:25,039
for cash. I want 100 soups.

181
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:26,374
- Soups?
- Yeah, ramen.

182
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:27,842
They're like a major currency in here.

183
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:29,176
Really? That is very surprising.

184
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,478
You can't smoke anymore,

185
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:32,380
so ramen has replaced cigarettes.

186
00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:34,315
- NPR did a big thing on it.
- I thought they sold ramen

187
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:36,584
- at the prison commissary.
- I don't want commissary soups,

188
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:38,653
- you stupid little bitch boy.
- Okay, that's fair.

189
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:40,154
- I deserve that.
- I want flavors

190
00:06:40,188 --> 00:06:41,656
you can only get on the outside...

191
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,891
Chili-lime shrimp,
southwestern chicken...

192
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:45,993
- Street flavors.
- Picante beef.

193
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:48,162
Oh, that's my favorite.

194
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:51,332
Get me picante beef, bitch boy.

195
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:55,202
Okay, so I just get some ramen

196
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:57,505
and then I get a cell phone.
Prison is easy.

197
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,341
You stood too close

198
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,343
- to the fence.
- Yeah, I know, Caleb!

199
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:06,080
Captain, Diaz sent us a list of favors

200
00:07:06,114 --> 00:07:08,182
she needs us to do for her.
She didn't hold back.

201
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:10,384
First, she wants us to
move all her furniture

202
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:12,019
- into storage.
- Okay.

203
00:07:12,054 --> 00:07:13,521
- Then file her taxes for her.
- Really?

204
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:15,923
And then she wants us
to type up and email

205
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,593
these letters to Pimento in Argentina.

206
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:21,262
- Are they sexual in nature?
- Crazy sexual.

207
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:23,531
But we can't say no. She's behind bars

208
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:26,067
- and we made a promise.
- Right. You're right.

209
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:28,903
Oh, also, she's worried
about her motorcycle

210
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:30,471
sitting idle, so she
wants us to take it out

211
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,540
once a day. Here.

212
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:35,042
I think you should do this.
You're more the biker type.

213
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:36,611
I've seen you use a
toothpick in public.

214
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:38,579
Motorcycles are death machines.

215
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:40,648
I have three kids. I'm not risking it.

216
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:42,617
Are you saying my life matters less

217
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:44,385
because I don't conform

218
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,988
to society's heteronormative,
child-centric ideals?

219
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:49,390
Are you really playing
the gay card right now?

220
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:51,559
Yas, queen.

221
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,295
Thanks for coming down again.

222
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:55,930
- What's going on at work?
- Not much.

223
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:58,132
I'm investigating a
big-time money launderer.

224
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,302
Moves tons of cash... under the table.

225
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:06,073
It was stressful, because
the brass got involved,

226
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:08,576
so there were a lot of
eyes on the operation.

227
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:12,580
But in the end, they
gave us room to work.

228
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:16,951
Well, sounds like it was a
very successful operation.

229
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:23,591
Here you go, bro.

230
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:27,428
- 105 picante beef.
- Great.

231
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:29,096
I'll keep five packs for myself.

232
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:30,765
What do you want me
to do with the rest?

233
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:33,000
Thanks for the soups.
Here's your cell phone.

234
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:34,769
Thank you. And by the way,

235
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:36,604
as someone who's eaten a
lot of ramen in his life,

236
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:38,439
here's a tip: leave a
few noodles uncooked

237
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:41,142
and then sprinkle them on top
afterwards like a garnish.

238
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:45,312
Gives you an extra
little fun bonus crunch.

239
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:46,380
Ha-ha!

240
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:48,482
Saw you coming that time.

241
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:51,152
Like who's got prison all figured...

242
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:52,453
He threw the shiv.

243
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:54,455
You can't do that!

244
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:56,357
I can't believe
I'm hearing your voice.

245
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:58,225
I know. It's so amazing.

246
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,027
<i>And now every day can
be like visiting day,</i>

247
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:01,796
and we can just talk about
whatever, whenever...

248
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,731
Jake, Jake, Jake,
Jake-Jake-Jake-Jake-Jake.

249
00:09:03,765 --> 00:09:06,167
- I gotta go.
- Jake?

250
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:07,635
Hey, warden. What's up?

251
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:09,303
What the hell are these? I found them

252
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:11,672
- doing a sweep of your bunks.
- Oh, uh...

253
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:13,808
- we got those at the commissary.
- Picante beef.

254
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:15,309
You think I don't know

255
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:16,711
that picante beef is a street flavor?

256
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:18,579
I was being kind to you
by putting you two

257
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:20,347
in protective custody,
but if you're gonna

258
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:23,317
bring contraband into my
prison and flaunt my rules,

259
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:24,652
pack your bags.

260
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:26,520
- You're going to gen pop.
- Gen pop?

261
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:28,355
But my tough prison beard
hasn't fully grown in yet.

262
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,557
Just give me six or seven more years.

263
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,111
I can't believe we're going to gen pop.

264
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:37,581
A cop and a cannibal?

265
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:39,416
Everybody's gonna be trying to kill us.

266
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,151
I know. What are we gonna do?

267
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:42,519
You're a psychopath. You
can protect us in there,

268
00:09:42,553 --> 00:09:44,321
right? I mean, you killed and ate

269
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:45,989
- a bunch of people.
- They were children, Jake.

270
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:48,425
Weak little children.
One conk on the head

271
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:50,360
- was all it took.
- Damn it.

272
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:52,963
I can't believe I'm friends
with a cowardly cannibal.

273
00:09:52,997 --> 00:09:55,165
Here she comes. Big smiles.

274
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:59,269
- Hey, Rosa.
- Hey. How's my bike?

275
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:00,971
Great. It actually was a lot of fun

276
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:02,872
to ride... once I got the hang of it.

277
00:10:06,577 --> 00:10:08,612
And you were able to finish
everything on my list?

278
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:10,213
It wasn't too much, was it?

279
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:11,982
- No.
- Not at all.

280
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:14,451
If anything, you didn't
ask enough of us.

281
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:16,886
Great, 'cause I thought
of a few more things.

282
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:19,155
Oh, were you able to send
that email to Adrian?

283
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,357
Oh, yes, he wrote back right away.

284
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:22,359
It wasn't as graphic as I feared.

285
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:25,161
He wrote the number eight...

286
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:28,298
equal sign, equal sign,
equal sign, equal sign,

287
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:34,004
equal sign, equal sign,
equal sign, capital D...

288
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:36,006
oh. I see what this is.

289
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,340
- This is a...
- Yup.

290
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,242
Cream turkey.

291
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:41,177
You know, what I could
really go for is...

292
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:43,313
- People potpie?
- First of all, Jake,

293
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:45,348
great alliteration. Second of all,

294
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,050
just because I was
arrested for cannibalism

295
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:49,052
doesn't mean that all I
like to eat is people.

296
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:51,655
I was gonna say "a chicken burrito."

297
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:56,026
- Man, my cousin was so tasty.
- Oh, come on.

298
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,894
Oop... hello.

299
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,896
You're gonna die in here, cop.

300
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:05,235
- What's up, Caleb?
- 'Sup, Chico?

301
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,604
It's so crazy. They hate you so much,

302
00:11:07,638 --> 00:11:11,908
- they don't even care about me.
- Yeah, congratulations.

303
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:13,677
I think I'm gonna need to join a gang.

304
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:15,545
And that way I'll have protection

305
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:17,380
- and no one will mess with me.
- I don't know, man.

306
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:19,382
- Joining a gang is not that easy.
- It would be for me.

307
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:22,018
I once took a seminar on
how to ace job interviews,

308
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:24,220
- and I'm really good at them.
- Really?

309
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:27,223
- This I've gotta see.
- Hey, everyone, I'm Jake.

310
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:29,259
Thank you so much for
sitting down with me.

311
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,061
I just need a moment of your time,

312
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:33,129
and then you can get back
to watching your stories.

313
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:34,731
What can I tell you about myself?

314
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:37,233
Well, I'm hardworking,
incredibly motivated.

315
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:39,402
I can make a shiv out of anything.

316
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:42,072
I am deceptively athletic. I'm
not sure if your gang likes

317
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:44,574
to play B-ball out in the
yard, but I can dunk.

318
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:46,276
Oakley...

319
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,578
And I'm just super excited to join...

320
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:51,114
- What are you guys called again?
- ISIS.

321
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:53,283
ISIS...

322
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:54,584
cool.

323
00:11:54,618 --> 00:11:56,619
Well, I am excited to join...

324
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:58,288
ISIS.

325
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:01,624
I can't believe I went 0 for 16.

326
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,260
I got rejected by my safety gang.

327
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:06,096
I'm gonna die in here.

328
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,630
Well, there is one more option,

329
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:09,499
but it's a long shot.
Remember that guy Romero

330
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:11,501
who you got the cell phone from?
If you got in good

331
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:14,104
with his crew, nobody
would dare touch you.

332
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:16,439
But he is real scary and crazy.

333
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:18,308
Okay, and how anti-Semitic is he?

334
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:22,178
- Average?
- Then let's give it a shot!

335
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:25,482
So, Picante Beef, I hear you wanna be

336
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,517
- part of my crew.
- Not ideally the nickname

337
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,185
I would've chosen for myself, but yes,

338
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,687
I think I could be of help to you.

339
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:32,789
Do you know how long I've
been in this prison?

340
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:35,992
17 years!

341
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:37,660
- Well, you look great.
- And not once,

342
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:40,330
- in all of that time, Beefy...
- It's just "Beefy" now?

343
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:43,533
Have I ever seen anything
as disrespectful

344
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:47,003
as a cop coming into my prison

345
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:49,139
telling me how to eat my soups!

346
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:53,343
But damn!

347
00:12:53,377 --> 00:12:56,279
Crumbling the noodle on
top gives it an extra

348
00:12:56,313 --> 00:12:57,514
little crispity-snap!

349
00:12:57,548 --> 00:12:59,649
I was blown away. Wasn't I, Tank?

350
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:01,518
Hasn't stopped talking about it.

351
00:13:01,552 --> 00:13:03,620
Come here, Beef Baby!

352
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:08,291
Great. So, does this mean

353
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:11,027
- that I'm part of the crew?
- Nobody can touch you now.

354
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:13,296
Wow, guess all it took
was the ramen tip.

355
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,731
Actually, you gotta do
one more thing for me

356
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:16,666
- to close the deal.
- Absolutely no problem.

357
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,668
Actually, I have a great
idea for a ramen dessert.

358
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:22,472
- You make it with Jell-O mix.
- I need you to kill a guard.

359
00:13:22,506 --> 00:13:24,707
Oh... okay. Great.

360
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:26,476
Cool-cool-cool-cool, cool-cool-cool.

361
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,145
Beef Baby's out for blood.

362
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,280
So...

363
00:13:32,008 --> 00:13:34,711
Okay, this guard you
gotta kill, Wilsom...

364
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:36,169
Oh, I'd rather not know his name.

365
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:38,316
It's Alan Wilson. He's
got a three-year-old,

366
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:39,642
Dexter. They call him Dex.

367
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:41,410
Cool. I'm not worried at all

368
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,873
about little Dex. I'm
sure he'll be fine.

369
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,256
- I mean, I grew up without a dad.
- Yeah?

370
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,957
- Me too.
- So did I.

371
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,125
See? And we're all doing great.

372
00:13:47,247 --> 00:13:48,981
Can I ask what this Wilson did

373
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:50,382
- to deserve this?
- He beat the crap out of me.

374
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,050
- How?
- More importantly, he keeps

375
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:54,219
interfering with my business interests.

376
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:55,554
But it's about my thing too, right?

377
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:56,955
Of course.

378
00:13:58,591 --> 00:14:01,960
How are you gonna do it? Shiv
him, shank him, stab him?

379
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:04,129
Are those different?

380
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:06,465
Oh, boy. Should I be asking

381
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,400
- someone else to do this?
- No, no, no, no.

382
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:10,068
It's fine. I'm gonna
prove myself to you.

383
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:13,038
But what if instead of killing Wilson,

384
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:14,706
we get him fired? That
way, you don't have

385
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:16,141
another man's death on your conscience.

386
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:17,476
Yeah, that doesn't bother me.

387
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,077
No, of course not. Why would it?

388
00:14:19,112 --> 00:14:20,712
But if we murder him, there's gonna be

389
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:22,347
an investigation, and that
could bring a lot of heat

390
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:24,082
- down on you, you know?
- I can see that.

391
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:25,417
But that's not how we usually
do things around here.

392
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:27,085
Sure, but you know what else

393
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
you didn't used to do around here...

394
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:30,689
Sprinkle uncooked noodles
on top of your ramen.

395
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:37,596
You're right. You're right.

396
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,731
You've earned the benefit of the doubt.

397
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:41,700
You have 24 hours, Beef Baby.

398
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:44,102
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.

399
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:45,270
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.

400
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:46,438
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.

401
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:47,606
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.

402
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,408
- Jake.
- Beef. Baby!

403
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:53,045
Beef Baby.

404
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,279
Okay, here's the plan.

405
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:56,081
Tank said Wilson beats up inmates,

406
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:57,616
so all I have to do is
get him to attack me

407
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,418
and then file a complaint
with the prison board.

408
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:01,620
Sure, but whenever the
bulls attack us...

409
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:04,089
Which happens all the time...
the security cameras

410
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:05,624
are conveniently not working that day,

411
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:08,026
so it's just your word against theirs.

412
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:10,429
Well, lucky for me, I
have my own camera.

413
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:12,564
It's the perfect plan. Hey, I've never

414
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:14,099
been beaten up by a
prison guard before.

415
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:15,634
They don't use that baton, do they?

416
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:17,302
You seem pretty committed to this plan,

417
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:19,137
so there's no real
benefit to me answering.

418
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:20,372
Sounds good.

419
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:21,807
So, you painted my apartment?

420
00:15:21,841 --> 00:15:24,142
Walls in "White Wisp,"
trim in "Honeymilk."

421
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:25,610
- And you filed my taxes.
- You're getting

422
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:27,379
- your maximum refund.
- And picked up

423
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,214
- my abuela at the airport?
- Yes, I went and got her

424
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:31,450
at the Philadelphia
International Airport in...

425
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:33,251
- Pennsylvania.
- And you broke the news to her

426
00:15:33,286 --> 00:15:34,820
about how I got sent to prison
and she'll probably die

427
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:36,455
- before I get out?
- Mm-hmm, had that

428
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:38,056
- fun conversation.
- But it was all worth it

429
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:40,592
for you, you poor little caged bird.

430
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:42,327
Great, because I have
another favor to ask.

431
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:43,729
- Another?
- Yeah, I need you

432
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:45,097
to cancel my cable.

433
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:47,799
That's it?

434
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:51,503
That's easy.

435
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:53,138
I've been on the phone for six hours

436
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:55,140
and I just wanna cancel an account.

437
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:56,508
Yes, you've mentioned the bundles

438
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,343
and I don't want home phone service.

439
00:15:58,378 --> 00:16:00,779
No, do not transfer me, Rodrigo...
no, no!

440
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:03,582
No, Rodrigo!

441
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:05,183
All right, there's Wilson.

442
00:16:05,218 --> 00:16:07,252
I'll go make him mad.
When he attacks me,

443
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:09,154
you film it. Then afterwards,

444
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:10,822
- we'll meet up in the bathroom.
- Okay, great.

445
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:12,090
What are you gonna do to get him angry?

446
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,425
Well, I don't know him,

447
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:14,693
so I'm not sure what buttons to push,

448
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:16,595
but I'm sure if I try enough things,

449
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:19,164
something will set him off.

450
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:20,799
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?

451
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,667
- Get back to your table.
- Yeah, you know, I would,

452
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:24,703
except for...

453
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:26,505
- Oh, my God, that's all it took?
- I told you

454
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,173
to get back to your table!

455
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,611
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

456
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:34,379
What hurts the most is knowing

457
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:35,881
that prisoners are treated
this way every day

458
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:37,449
in our penal system...
also, he kicked me

459
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:39,217
- in the wiener a bunch.
- Mm.

460
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:40,719
Show me the video. I'll
send it to Charles,

461
00:16:40,753 --> 00:16:42,621
he'll say he got it
anonymously, and then...

462
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:44,856
<i>Oh, my
God, that's all it took?</i>

463
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:47,492
Caleb, is this it? Did
you film yourself

464
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:48,794
- the whole time?
- Okay, look, I've been

465
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:50,862
in prison for 15 years. I'm not good

466
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:52,697
with new technology.

467
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:54,232
You want somebody to
lure a kid to a park

468
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:56,668
using a Lycos chatroom, I'm your man.

469
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:58,537
Look, just press this button

470
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:01,339
and make it front-facing.
Come on, let's try it again.

471
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:02,874
Hey, Wilson...

472
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,913
Please tell me you were pointed

473
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:09,414
in the right direction that time.

474
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:11,917
Yes, but there was a different issue.

475
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:17,255
Caleb! You added the fiesta filter?

476
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,591
- I'm doing the best I can.
- Tell that to my wiener!

477
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,360
- I'm doing the...
- No, don't really... gosh...

478
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:26,665
Okay, how'd you screw it up this time?

479
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,433
I didn't. I got everything.

480
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:30,268
I even zoomed in for some close-ups.

481
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:32,270
Oh, thank God.

482
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:34,372
I was so sure that something
was gonna go wrong.

483
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:35,841
Hey there, Peralta.

484
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:39,244
Oh, I'll take that phone now.

485
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:42,870
I heard an inmate and a guard
were having a fight.

486
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,697
So I go to do what I normally do:

487
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,943
- turn off the security cameras.
- Yup, cool policy.

488
00:17:46,977 --> 00:17:48,711
- This place is great.
- And that's when I noticed

489
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:51,047
your cannibal pal
taping the whole fight

490
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:53,082
with an illegal cell phone.
And what were you planning

491
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:55,318
on doing with this?
Blackmailing Wilson?

492
00:17:55,352 --> 00:17:57,086
No, I was trying to save his life.

493
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:58,721
- Ah, come on.
- Honestly.

494
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:00,123
I was ordered by this guy, Romero.

495
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:01,791
- I don't know his first name.
- Jeff?

496
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:03,159
Really? Romero's first name is Jeff?

497
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:04,994
- Yeah.
- Anyway, Jeff ordered me

498
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:06,396
to kill Wilson, but I
convinced him to let

499
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,264
your guy live if I got
him fired instead.

500
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:10,166
Why do you want him to lose his job?

501
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:12,135
- He's a good man with a family.
- I mean, he did stomp

502
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:14,237
- on my head a bunch of times.
- Those were warning stomps.

503
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:16,339
What are you, part of
Romero's crew now?

504
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:18,808
No, I was trying to get in.
That's what the video was for,

505
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:20,310
- but obviously, it didn't work.
- All right.

506
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:24,747
- I'll fire Wilson.
- Really?

507
00:18:24,782 --> 00:18:26,416
- Why?
- Romero's responsible

508
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,251
for most of the illegal stuff
that goes on in this prison.

509
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:29,986
I've always wanted a man on the inside.

510
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,955
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

511
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:33,957
The only people less popular in
here than cops are snitches.

512
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:35,325
Well, let's be honest,

513
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,793
it's not great in here
for trans people.

514
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:38,194
- That is so true.
- I know.

515
00:18:38,229 --> 00:18:40,430
- They have a hard time.
- It's a problem.

516
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:42,966
Regardless, I won't snitch, okay?

517
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,801
It's too dangerous. I'll
find some other way

518
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:45,935
- to stay alive.
- All right.

519
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,103
Good luck with that.

520
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:52,809
Wait.

521
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:55,111
I'll do what you want...

522
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:56,980
if you let me keep my phone.

523
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:59,315
So, were you able to cancel my cable?

524
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,884
Of course. It was easy.

525
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:03,119
Good, because I have something else.

526
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:05,021
I need you to take my dog to Argentina

527
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:06,856
to be with Adrian on his ranch.
Now, I know what you're gonna

528
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:08,191
ask me, and the answer is no,

529
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:09,459
I don't have a map of the booby traps,

530
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:10,727
but I can tell you how he thinks.

531
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:12,295
Enough!

532
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:14,163
I'm sorry. I hate to say this,

533
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:18,067
but you're asking too much of us.

534
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:19,435
Is that how you feel too, Sarge?

535
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:23,206
- Yeah, Rosa, damn.
- Good, finally.

536
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,842
- What?
- Look, prison is awful.

537
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,977
I hate it here. I'm lonely, I'm scared.

538
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:29,846
I just wanna be back
home, and I was happy

539
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,481
you guys were coming to
visit, but then you started

540
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,349
calling me by my first
name, and you kept making

541
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:35,351
that crazy crying face. The
only one that is acting

542
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:38,187
- like himself is Hitchcock.
- You!

543
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:41,357
- Shirt back on!
- Stop being such a prude.

544
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:43,259
If I'm gonna get through
this, I need to feel like

545
00:19:43,294 --> 00:19:46,496
my old life isn't gone. I
need normal interactions.

546
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,097
So, I need you guys to fight with me,

547
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:49,732
and be honest with me, and tell me no

548
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,768
when I'm being unreasonable.

549
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:54,737
Okay, I promise: no more crying face.

550
00:19:54,772 --> 00:19:56,506
And no more pity... Diaz.

551
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,874
Thank you. I can't believe it took

552
00:19:57,908 --> 00:19:59,208
that long. I really thought

553
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:00,777
the cable company was gonna break you.

554
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:02,412
It did. But the good news is,

555
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:04,514
you now have Epix, plus some channel

556
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:06,950
called "Tunez," with a Z.

557
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:08,217
Two-year commitment.

558
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,888
What else? Oh, you're never gonna

559
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:13,389
believe this. I've been reading.

560
00:20:13,424 --> 00:20:15,558
Reading? Like, books by real authors?

561
00:20:15,592 --> 00:20:17,760
I don't know, is Philip
Roth a real author?

562
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:20,229
Oh, my goodness!

563
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:21,965
I wish you had gone
to prison years ago.

564
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:24,067
I'm kidding. Obviously, I'm not

565
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:25,969
more attracted to you now than before.

566
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:29,105
<i>So, what else have you been reading?</i>

567
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:31,574
Oh, hang on one sec.

568
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,910
- Hey, boss, what's up?
- I saw you got Wilson fired.

569
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:35,812
Nice work. Welcome aboard.

570
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:37,246
Thank you. I promise you,

571
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:38,982
you won't regret it.

572
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:42,819
Just one more thing.

573
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:45,455
I know you used to be a cop.

574
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:48,491
If you screw me over, I
will cut your testicles off

575
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:50,259
and watch you bleed
to death in the dirt.

576
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:52,996
You got that?

577
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,564
Can I trust you?

578
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:57,433
Yeah. I got nothing to hide.

579
00:20:57,468 --> 00:20:59,902
I'm your Beef Baby.

580
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:08,111
<i>Hey, sorry about that.</i>

581
00:21:08,145 --> 00:21:10,947
- Where were we?
- Jake, that sounded really bad.

582
00:21:10,981 --> 00:21:12,448
- Is everything okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

583
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:15,985
Everything's fine. I'm talking to you.

1
00:00:01,992 --> 00:00:03,627
Hey, Charles, want to grab
a beer before you go home?

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,230
- Ooh, a yeast feast.
- Never mind.

3
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:06,230
No, no, no, I want to go, it's just,

4
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:08,432
there's a huge emergency
I have to deal with first.

5
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:09,766
Oh, no. Is everything okay?

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,835
It's about my food truck.

7
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:12,236
I have to get a parking spot.

8
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,503
Oh. That doesn't sound as intense

9
00:00:13,537 --> 00:00:14,839
as you were making it out to be.

10
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:17,242
- Move your ass, you old bitch!
- What is happening?

11
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:18,575
We have to get there by 7:00

12
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,445
when they lift the parking restrictions.

13
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,224
It's the best spot in Brooklyn,
and everyone wants it.

14
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:24,584
Get the hell out of the way!

15
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:30,590
Charles, I highly doubt
the entire food truck industry

16
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:32,057
is racing to get into this one spot.

17
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,592
It's not "Mad Max."

18
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,860
We're neck and neck with rice pudding.

19
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:36,629
You got Korean tacos on your six.

20
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,864
Oh, my God, it's real.
We're on the Fury Road.

21
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:41,167
Witness me, blood bag!

22
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:42,535
Hold on tight!

23
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:56,304
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

24
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:16,643
That was the most stressful
thing I've ever gone through,

25
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:18,137
and I was wrongfully imprisoned
last year.

26
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,572
That was fun.

27
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:22,007
Every aspect of owning
a food truck is fun.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,676
It is fun, fun, fun.

29
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,623
What the hell do you want, Troy?

30
00:01:25,648 --> 00:01:26,857
You stole my spot, you son of a bitch!

31
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:28,160
Oh, go on, get out of here.

32
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,995
- You're just jealous.
- I'm not going anywhere! I made a signal,

33
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:31,329
- and you made an illegal U-turn!
- Give me a break.

34
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:33,030
- I should call the cops!
- Oh, are you gonna

35
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:34,299
- call the cops?
- Yeah, I'm gonna call the cops!

36
00:01:34,332 --> 00:01:35,967
- I am the cops!
- Oh, you're a cop now?

37
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:36,968
Why don't you go back
to your garbage truck

38
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:38,303
and cook some pudding?

39
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:39,304
You're gonna regret this.

40
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:41,505
Kill yourself, Troy!

41
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:43,308
Jake, I have a confession to make.

42
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:45,323
The food truck is kind of
stressing me out.

43
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:49,955
Bad news, Captain.
A water main burst downtown.

44
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:51,970
- There's been several injuries.
- Oh, that's unfortunate.

45
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:53,873
And the victims are
in our blah-blah-blah,

46
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,240
but tell him the real tragedy, Terry.

47
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:56,374
Olivia Crawford...

48
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,210
AKA your main commish competish.

49
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:00,745
Tweeted a statement addressing
the water main break,

50
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:03,114
and she's been retweeted by the mayor.

51
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:05,116
"Kudos to our brave officers"...

52
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,085
- Hey, now.
- Whoa! What is going on?

53
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:08,754
It's in all caps.

54
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:10,388
Anyway, I don't see
how this is bad news.

55
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,124
Because the commissioner race,

56
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:13,291
like all of life,

57
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:14,760
is a popularity contest,

58
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:17,296
and Olivia is sitting
at the hot senior table

59
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:20,099
whilst you are eating lunch alone.

60
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:23,201
If the mayor wants to make me
the next NYPD commissioner,

61
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:25,438
it'll be because of my record
and my qualifications,

62
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,439
not my social media presence.

63
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:29,208
- This is a serious job.
<i>- I know.</i>

64
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,043
But like it or not,
the decision is political,

65
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:34,914
and social media
is a part of politics now.

66
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,915
- You need a Twitter account.
- Not gonna happen.

67
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,784
The whole thing is inane.

68
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:41,320
Besides, 140 characters is far more

69
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:42,821
than anyone needs to make a point.

70
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:45,323
They actually upped it to 280.

71
00:02:45,357 --> 00:02:46,826
Oh, good God.

72
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,194
<i>I'm so miserable, Jake.</i>

73
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:50,195
The truck is hemorrhaging money.
I'm going bankrupt.

74
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:51,996
- I never see my family.
- All right, look.

75
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:54,399
You just have to find a way
to reduce expenses.

76
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:56,268
I've started saving $200 a month

77
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,803
just by buying "John Wick"

78
00:02:57,835 --> 00:02:59,137
instead of renting it every two nights.

79
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:00,106
I have cut costs.

80
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,507
I fired my only employee, Ted,
which was awful.

81
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,076
Okay, look, I hate to ask this,

82
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:05,945
but have you considered
shutting the truck down?

83
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,846
You're always bragging about
how much Boyles love to give up.

84
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,482
I can't. I'm in so much debt.

85
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:11,149
I took out a loan for the truck.

86
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:12,852
I got Amy to invest.

87
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:15,087
No, the only way out
of this hole is to keep digging.

88
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,088
That's not how holes work...
title of your sex tape...

89
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:18,423
Charles, look, you're gonna

90
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:20,126
find your way out of this, I swear.

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,861
- It's all gonna work out.
- You're right.

92
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:24,063
You know, if I just work hard
and stay positive,

93
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:25,463
I'm sure it'll be a huge success

94
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,766
and everything will be okay.

95
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:27,932
There you go.

96
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:31,470
Hello? Oh.

97
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,905
Okay. No, thank you.

98
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,007
So my truck burned down.

99
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,109
Hey.

100
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:38,944
Someone robbed a bodega on 4th Street.

101
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:40,278
It's the fifth one this week.

102
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:42,248
It's so sad that
someone's targeting bodegas.

103
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,016
They're part of the fabric of New York.

104
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:45,817
- You shop at them a lot?
- No. They overcharge

105
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:46,952
for everything, and they sell rat poison

106
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:48,254
right next to the bananas.

107
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:50,022
Yeah, they're gross.
I hope they never change.

108
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:51,256
Anyway, Holt wants us to interview

109
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,924
some of the bodega owners and figure out

110
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,493
where to assign
additional uniformed officers.

111
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,028
I put a map up on the server...

112
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,962
No! Just email it to me.

113
00:03:57,995 --> 00:03:59,798
I hate servers. Bye!

114
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,132
Wait. Why'd you close
your laptop so fast?

115
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,935
- What are you hiding?
- Nurthing.

116
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:04,203
- You're hiding something.
- What?

117
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:06,471
- Just 'cause I said "nurthing"?
- Yes.

118
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:08,808
No!

119
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,909
Aww, you're looking at wedding dresses?

120
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:12,877
- That one's dope.
- That's not what I was doing.

121
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,412
My computer must've gone
to this site on its own.

122
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,482
- How is that possible?
- It's broken, Y2K.

123
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:17,817
I'll fix it.

124
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,351
There, it's fixed.

125
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,021
- You're weird.
- I know.

126
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,522
Oh, God. My truck.

127
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,090
This truck was my baby!

128
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:26,591
All right, look, Charles,
I know you're upset,

129
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,027
but maybe there's a silver lining here.

130
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,328
- I mean, you had insurance, right?
- Yeah. I already called them.

131
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:31,815
So maybe you'll get some money for this,

132
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:33,899
and you can pay off your debts,
starting with Amy.

133
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:35,500
I'm sorry, that was selfish.
Forget I said it.

134
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:37,336
You can pay off your debts,
starting with Amy.

135
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:38,503
Whoops, I did it again.

136
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:40,171
You're right. This is my way out.

137
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:41,173
It's a miracle.

138
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:42,307
Oh, my God!

139
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:43,976
Jake? Boyle?

140
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:45,511
Adrian. What are you doing here?

141
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:46,611
I'm an insurance investigator now.

142
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:48,079
I thought you were in Alaska.

143
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:50,115
Oh, yeah, I was,
after Rosa and I broke up,

144
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:51,316
but then I accidentally killed

145
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,885
a "protected buffalo"... self-defense.

146
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,555
Next thing I know, Fish and Game
are all over my ass.

147
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,189
I ended up in a fight with a bear,

148
00:04:58,223 --> 00:05:00,292
and I had to think to myself,
why am I even here?

149
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:02,127
Wait a minute. You fought a bear?

150
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:03,462
Big time. The trick on that:

151
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,331
head-butt him in the penis,
push him over a cliff.

152
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:06,931
Ah, I bet that works
with a lot of animals.

153
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:08,166
Only the male ones.

154
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,534
- Learned that the hard way.
- Hmm.

155
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,002
Anyway, you know that if you guys want

156
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:12,637
to get in touch with me,
there's easier ways

157
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:14,305
than burning down your truck, right?

158
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:16,208
What? Burning down my truck?

159
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,510
Yeah, it's obviously arson, you did it,

160
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:19,644
you're not gonna get a dime

161
00:05:19,678 --> 00:05:21,213
and are probably gonna go to jail.

162
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:23,790
So... what's going on with you guys?

163
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:26,165
Give me that juicy
Nine-Nine goss, am I right?

164
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,741
This is insane.

165
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,984
I mean, Charles loved this truck.
It's his baby.

166
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,208
There's no way he'd burn it down.

167
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:37,682
The world is a messed up place, Jake.

168
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:38,715
People kill their babies.

169
00:05:38,748 --> 00:05:39,950
Babies kill their parents.

170
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:41,652
It's the circle of life.

171
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:44,055
- That was clearly a triangle.
- Okay, fine, busted.

172
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:45,822
I just had the stove's gas line cleaned.

173
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,524
Maybe it was put back in wrong
or something.

174
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:49,726
Look, I've caught
enough arsonists in my day

175
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,027
to know that the owner always does it.

176
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,674
Chuck, how's the truck been doing?

177
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:53,890
- Pretty terrible.
- Hmm?

178
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,599
I was just saying,
it's a miracle it burned down.

179
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:57,253
Okay, I know Charles
sounds hella guilty right now,

180
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:58,435
but you know he didn't do it.

181
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:59,496
Charles, this isn't
looking good for you.

182
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,215
Anybody else that might have
done this? Any enemies?

183
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:02,453
Well, my dad's best friend and I

184
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:03,924
have a pretty intense rivalry,

185
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,523
but I don't think my aunt
would do anything illegal.

186
00:06:05,556 --> 00:06:06,758
Oh, my God.

187
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,692
Wait. The rice pudding truck guy!

188
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:10,727
Oh, my God. That bastard Troy.

189
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,206
We just got into a fight
about this very parking spot.

190
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:15,198
- He said I'd regret it.
- Yeah, and that's what happened.

191
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:16,234
You're regretting it!

192
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:17,839
Come on, you know
we didn't commit arson.

193
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:19,636
- Adrian, this is us.
- Not the TV show.

194
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:20,907
- We are your friends.
- Not the movie.

195
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,008
- You got to have faith.
- Not the song.

196
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,176
Are you doing this on purpose?

197
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,198
- The third one, yes.
- Okay.

198
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:26,346
I'll admit, arson does seem
out of character for you.

199
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:27,869
Okay, look me in the eyes.

200
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:31,368
Look me in the eyes like the bear did.

201
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:39,911
Okay.

202
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:41,879
I believe you, and together,

203
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:43,885
we're gonna catch the SOB that did this.

204
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,652
I'm so glad he didn't
head-butt me in the penis.

205
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:49,299
That's all I was thinking about.

206
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:50,822
<i>Cheddar!</i>

207
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,423
- That's a really good job.
- Stay, stay.

208
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:54,626
What's going on here?
Why is Cheddar here?

209
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:55,759
And why is he in swim trunks?

210
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,295
Because the little sailor outfit

211
00:06:57,327 --> 00:06:58,829
- wouldn't fit his tush.
- Excuse me?

212
00:06:58,863 --> 00:07:00,497
We're setting you up a Twitter account,

213
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:01,699
and the fastest way to get followers

214
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:02,933
is cute animal pics.

215
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:04,534
I follow an account that's just

216
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:07,014
this one real grouchy chinchilla.

217
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,575
He hates waking up so much!

218
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:10,710
He really does. He's like "Ooh!"

219
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,011
This is ridiculous.

220
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:13,713
This has nothing to do with police work.

221
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:15,081
Exactly. It's about being noticed,

222
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:16,984
and right now, no one is noticing you.

223
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:18,684
I didn't even realize we were talking

224
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:20,052
to a third party, presently.

225
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:22,054
Fine. If you really
think it's necessary,

226
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:24,491
I will establish
a social media presence.

227
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:25,858
But I'll be setting up my own accounts,

228
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:27,126
and I assure you,

229
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,996
I won't be resorting to foolish gimmicks
involving my dog.

230
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,864
Uh, you might want
to rethink that stance,

231
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:34,133
because how cute would Cheddar
look in this hat?

232
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,102
Please. When it comes to clothes,

233
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:38,638
Cheddar wears little booties
in the snow,

234
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:41,142
or Cheddar wears nothing.

235
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:44,110
Troy's not home, but I say we wait.

236
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:46,946
I have some hard questions
for that rice pudding bastard.

237
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,482
So, Adrian, how's life
as an insurance investigator?

238
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:50,917
It's amazing. At Gray Star Mutual,

239
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,986
they let me do whatever I want,

240
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:55,155
as long as I'm getting that job
done, and you know I am.

241
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:57,124
Last week, I waterboarded a dude.

242
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:58,892
- Oh, that's not legal.
- Doesn't matter.

243
00:07:58,924 --> 00:08:00,994
I'm not a cop.
Anyway, what's up with you guys?

244
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:02,463
Hey, Jake, who you porking?

245
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:06,032
Uh, I guess Amy and I are still...

246
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:08,035
- I don't want to say it.
- Yep.

247
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:10,037
- Porking.
- Yeah, you are. Nice.

248
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,505
Actually, we got engaged.

249
00:08:11,537 --> 00:08:13,006
What the hell? How come I didn't know?

250
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,608
I thought we were supposed
to be friends.

251
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,910
Oh, wait a minute.
Did this, like, just happen?

252
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:18,912
Well, it was at Halloween.

253
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:20,547
Wha... no, that's so long ago!

254
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,649
Charles, are you just
finding out about this too?

255
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:23,917
No, I was there.

256
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,551
You were there? Who else?

257
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:26,787
Who else got to be a part of this?

258
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,156
Nobody, you know, just...

259
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:30,657
Holt and...

260
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,059
- Terry and Rosa.
- Okay.

261
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:33,894
- And Hitchcock and Scully.
- Seriously?

262
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:35,095
And this creepy guy named Bill.

263
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:36,997
Oh, come on! I'm the creepy guy

264
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:38,931
that's supposed to be at stuff
that you have happen.

265
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,566
Look, you just left town,

266
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,503
and we don't exactly have
a text relationship...

267
00:08:42,536 --> 00:08:43,604
How dare you?

268
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:45,705
May 10th, I texted you,

269
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:47,273
I'm at the Gaga concert, you here,

270
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:49,142
question mark, question mark,
question mark.

271
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:52,079
You texted back, No. Frowny face.

272
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:53,980
Look, I've been really busy.
I'm sorry, okay?

273
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:55,782
I understand.

274
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:58,085
You know, I just didn't hear
about this one thing.

275
00:08:58,118 --> 00:08:59,953
I mean, I can't imagine
there are any other

276
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:02,855
major milestones that I've missed.

277
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:04,157
- Are there?
- I mean, Amy's a sergeant.

278
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,225
- No.
- And Holt's up

279
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:06,926
- for commissioner.
- Seriously?

280
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,829
And Dr. Ronald Yee came to the precinct

281
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:10,062
and taught a course on forensics.

282
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:11,831
The Dr. Ronald Yee?

283
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:13,066
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God!

284
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,243
- Yee was in the building?
- Yeah.

285
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:16,728
Wow, didn't realize
the Yee news was up there

286
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:18,104
- with the other stuff.
- Oh, come on, Jake.

287
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:20,773
Yee only wrote the book on
forensic facial reconstruction.

288
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:22,075
He's a rock star!

289
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:23,744
You guys could have texted me, but no,

290
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:26,979
because I bet you haven't
thought about me once

291
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:28,581
since I dumped Rosa.

292
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:30,082
- Did you dump her?
- You know what?

293
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:32,619
I need some air. I'm storming out.

294
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:35,022
I'm storming out!

295
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,924
So I can spare four uniformed officers

296
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:39,258
to do hourly pass-bys
of the bodegas south of 4th,

297
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,994
and I'll coordinate with the, um...

298
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:43,162
hourly pass-bys of the...

299
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:44,630
Wait. What was that?

300
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:46,198
That was me talking about
hourly pass-bys.

301
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:48,100
Oh, yeah, I heard about
the hourly pass-bys.

302
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,137
Twice. I meant...

303
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,606
That subtle side look.

304
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:54,007
There was no subtle side look.

305
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,242
You're right, 'cause it wasn't subtle.

306
00:09:55,274 --> 00:09:58,077
It was an unsubtle side look at...

307
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,245
that dress in the shop.

308
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:00,780
Why are you being such a nutjob

309
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:02,115
about looking for a wedding dress?

310
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:04,884
Because being
a female sergeant is difficult.

311
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,085
I have to work twice as hard

312
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,620
to gain my officers' respect,

313
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:10,023
and looking at girly dresses
isn't going to help.

314
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:12,893
Plus, it's a new job, and I need
to make it a priority.

315
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:14,294
Dude, I get that, but if you want

316
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:16,830
a beautiful wedding dress,
you deserve to find one.

317
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:17,898
Look, there are no cops around.

318
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:19,199
Nobody's gonna see you.

319
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,799
Why don't we just take our break now,

320
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:21,825
try one on?

321
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,385
- Okay?
- Okay.

322
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,814
- Okay?
- Okay.

323
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:25,905
- Okay?
- Okay.

324
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,342
Hell yeah!

325
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:29,342
They are closed.

326
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,043
- We will come back later.
- Yeah.

327
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:33,179
<i>Where did Adrian go? He seemed upset.</i>

328
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:34,647
- Should we be worried?
- Always.

329
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,917
We should always be worried about him.

330
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,652
Jake. Look, look.

331
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:41,135
Excuse me, Troy Lunniker, we are...

332
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,846
I know exactly who you are,
you spot-stealing

333
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,265
- son of a bitch!
- I didn't steal your spot!

334
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,325
- You were too slow, you idiot!
- You did steal my spot, man.

335
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,557
You with the horrible meatballs.

336
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:47,927
You should call them crap balls, man!

337
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,095
Oh, my food tastes like crap?

338
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:50,797
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop.

339
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,132
- Crap balls.
- Hey!

340
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:53,767
Look, Detective Boyle's truck
burned down.

341
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,135
Yeah, and you did it.

342
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,637
You torched my truck,
and you're going to jail.

343
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,805
Whoa. Someone burned down your truck?

344
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:00,740
I'm sorry, man, but I would
never do anything like that.

345
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:01,975
I swear it wasn't me.

346
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:03,643
Well, I'd love to believe you, Troy,

347
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:06,212
but I'm afraid we're gonna need
to see some proof.

348
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:07,947
Oh, my God, he had so much proof.

349
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,415
I can't believe he was on "Cash Cab"

350
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:10,951
at the exact moment
my truck burned down.

351
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:12,219
And he did so well.

352
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:14,186
He named every member of The Monkees.

353
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,056
- He even got Tork.
- No one gets Tork.

354
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,257
I know. All right, so if it wasn't Troy,

355
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,126
the question is, who could it have been?

356
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:20,926
What's up, jerks?

357
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:23,729
Pimento, you broke into my house?

358
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:25,331
Yeah. I'm an insurance investigator.

359
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:27,667
- I can do whatever I want.
- What are you doing here?

360
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,702
I'm working the case.
I'm looking for clues.

361
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:31,804
Come on, you already said
Charles couldn't do this.

362
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:32,972
- I couldn't do it.
- That's what I thought.

363
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:34,240
But then I realized,

364
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:36,275
if you can hide your engagement from me,

365
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:38,944
what else are you capable of hiding?

366
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:40,414
Oh, right. Arson!

367
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:42,249
Come on, don't you think
that's a bit of a stretch?

368
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:43,917
Is it? Lab tests came back

369
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,753
and said the accelerant used
in the fire was turpentine.

370
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:50,757
And look what I found
in Boyle's wife's closet.

371
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,392
Looks to me a lot like turpentine.

372
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:55,762
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

373
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:57,264
Turpentine, just like I thought.

374
00:11:57,297 --> 00:11:59,432
That's Genevieve's.
She uses it for her paintings.

375
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:03,269
Oh, likely story.

376
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:05,905
If that's the case,
then how do you explain this

377
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:06,907
that I found on your fridge?

378
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,907
My wedding invitation?

379
00:12:07,941 --> 00:12:09,276
Aha, so you admit it.

380
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:11,177
Invites have gone out,
and I didn't get one!

381
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,279
Oh, well, well, well.

382
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:15,282
Now you both are gonna pay.

383
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:16,717
- Adrian.
- Hey, come on.

384
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:18,051
Oh, I thought you were
reaching for a gun.

385
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:19,152
Oh, no, my friend.

386
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:20,821
This is much worse than a gun.

387
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:21,988
This is a stamp,

388
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:23,323
a stamp that says...

389
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,025
Denied.

390
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:28,461
Your claim is denied.

391
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:38,983
Do you really think
the insurance company

392
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,413
will replace Adrian
as the investigator on my case?

393
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:42,664
Yeah. It's Gray Star Mutual...

394
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,130
"Where the feeling is mutual."

395
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,467
And right now we're feeling
like we want a new investigator.

396
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,534
Hi, I'm Travis.

397
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,002
I've been reviewing your appeal.

398
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,072
I understand you have a problem
with Mr. Pimento.

399
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,539
Yes, we sort of have

400
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,509
a complicated preexisting relationship,

401
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,076
which I think is a conflict of interest.

402
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,644
Okay, I'll be honest,

403
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,081
we've had some problems
with Mr. Pimento before.

404
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,249
I think he may have
broken into my apartment once.

405
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,085
Oh, you'd know.
He leaves a lot of hair behind.

406
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,552
- He's a shedder.
- Mm-hmm.

407
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,087
Okay. I'll talk to my supervisor,

408
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,121
see what can be done.

409
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:10,756
Great. Thank you very much.

410
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,493
See, Charles?
Things are starting to look up.

411
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:14,628
Up your butt!

412
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,497
Adrian! What a coincidence.

413
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,511
We were just...
filing a complaint about you.

414
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,490
You were obviously listening.

415
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,500
I don't know why I'm trying to lie.

416
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,768
Oh, we're locked in. Great.

417
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,570
First you cut me out of your lives,

418
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,638
then you try and get me fired?

419
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,240
My therapist was right about you guys.

420
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,809
- You're a couple of dinguses.
- You have a therapist?

421
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,544
Yeah, he's helping me work on
my rotator cuff.

422
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,745
Oh, I see, it's a physical therapist.

423
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,914
Oh, he's very physical, Charles.

424
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,283
Very physical.

425
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:40,721
So what do you think?

426
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,788
Mm, I don't love the sash.

427
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,524
But it's fine. I'm just gonna get it.

428
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,092
What? That's the first one you tried on.

429
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,196
I once saw you look at 54
different accordion folders

430
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,698
and not buy any of them
due to weak tabs.

431
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,033
I file hard. I need strong tabs.

432
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,537
I just don't want to take up
any more time.

433
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,672
Your break's not even a quarter done.

434
00:13:58,705 --> 00:13:59,806
I'll stay another ten minutes.

435
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,174
You'll stay until I dismiss you.

436
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,445
Irene, music.

437
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:04,853
Now spin.

438
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,080
<i>All units, attempted 1030-Charlie.</i>

439
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,716
<i>Bodega on Smith.
Perp is heading east on Baltic.</i>

440
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,286
That's us! We're on Baltic.

441
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,820
Oh, crap. That was him!

442
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,822
<i>Hey!</i>

443
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,558
NYPD, stop!

444
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,831
Hey!

445
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,576
- <i>Stay down!</i>
- Damn, sarge.

446
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,579
Maybe I do like the sash.

447
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,812
Sir, brace yourself.

448
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,782
Olivia Crawford just tweeted a post

449
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,216
of an officer carrying a woman

450
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,784
through knee-deep flood waters.

451
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,986
Spoiler alert:
they are of different races.

452
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,288
Terry teared up.

453
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,923
I love when calamity brings
people together.

454
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,259
Sir, it got another retweet
from the mayor.

455
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,894
It got a retweet from the governor.

456
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,696
Well, I have already set up my accounts,

457
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,131
and not to toot my own bugle,

458
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,966
but I think I did an admirable job.

459
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,201
Oh, okay, what's your handle?
I'll be your first follower.

460
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:09,743
It's @5261796d6e6420486f6c74.

461
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,111
It spells "Raymond Holt"
in hexadecimal code.

462
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,947
- Clever, right?
- Captain, are you sure

463
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,349
you wouldn't like some help with this?

464
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,183
Oh, no need. Now, for my first tweet,

465
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,251
I think I should give an update
on the water main break

466
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:20,920
that's actually informative.

467
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:26,892
"NYC H20-Main SITREP: at 2040 EDT

468
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:33,133
current PSI 456 MAX CAP 204000 LPM."

469
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,670
Suck on that tasty lemon drop,
Olivia Crawford.

470
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,304
Oh, look at that. An alert.

471
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,006
I'm probably trending already.

472
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,841
What? My account has been deactivated?

473
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,275
Twitter thinks you're a bot.

474
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:45,379
Why? I am a human.

475
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,722
I am a human male.

476
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,316
<i>Adrian, open up.</i>

477
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,651
Get out of here, Travis!

478
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,751
Come on, Adrian, admit it.

479
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,052
You have a conflict of interest.

480
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,821
How could I have a conflict of interest?

481
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,723
We barely have a relationship.

482
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,190
We're not even friends anymore.

483
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,427
- You saw to that, didn't you?
- That's crazy.

484
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,129
We may have lost touch,
but we're still friends.

485
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:05,065
Oh, is that right, Jake?
Are we still friends?

486
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,333
If that's the case, then when
did I lose my virginity?

487
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,701
Oh, man, you've told us

488
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,336
so many intense graphic sex stories.

489
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,806
I have! But a true friend

490
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,042
always remembers a friend's first.

491
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,343
Jake, we know this!
It's got to be one of the swamps.

492
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,346
Uh, Florida swamp,
or Okefenokee Swamp, or...

493
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,681
oh, was it a bayou?

494
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:21,748
No, no, no! I've got it.

495
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,948
Summer of '91, at a screening

496
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,384
of "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves."

497
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,254
Well done.
It was Bryan Adams' soundtrack

498
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,956
and Kevin Costner's
flawless British accent

499
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,893
that put us in the mood to get gross.

500
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,828
Next question. Favorite shape?

501
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,028
- Oval?
- Of course!

502
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,964
- Favorite scent?
- Trick question.

503
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,966
You lost your sense of smell in a...

504
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,033
Shipwreck!

505
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,169
Guys, we are friends!

506
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,105
Aww, I love you guys.

507
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,008
Are you still angry?

508
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,711
No, that was a cathartic scream of love.

509
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:51,711
- Understood.
- Good.

510
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:52,745
Well, anyways, I'm sorry

511
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:53,813
about how things went down, man.

512
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,115
We should have stayed in touch.

513
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,983
No, it's just as much my fault as yours.

514
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,851
I could have kept in touch with you guys

515
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,986
and probably should have
told you about my new family.

516
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,088
Your new what now?

517
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,123
Ah, Travis. Great, you're here.

518
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,393
These gentlemen are innocent
and are free to go.

519
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,195
- You're fired, Adrian.
- What?

520
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,931
And as for you, my supervisor
and I reviewed your case.

521
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,932
Turpentine is all the proof
we need to deny your claim.

522
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,002
The feeling wasn't mutual.

523
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,258
You're so lame, you know that, Travis?

524
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:23,258
Wait a second.
Is this just because I did molly

525
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:24,862
- with your daughter?
- You did?

526
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:26,257
Don't think he knew about that.

527
00:17:26,282 --> 00:17:27,686
Just don't ever come back here again.

528
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:29,102
If you do, I'll have you arrested.

529
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,569
How dare you?

530
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:31,971
I gave you the best two weeks
of my life!

531
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:34,641
Oh, guys, I'm so screwed.
We got no leads.

532
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:35,641
I'm not gonna get any of the money back.

533
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:36,910
What do we do?

534
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:39,145
We go directly
to Travis' house right now,

535
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,546
pee on everything he owns,

536
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,749
and then burn that place to the ground.

537
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:42,916
- Adrian, that's it.
- It is?

538
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:44,485
- Yes! I knew it!
- No, no, no.

539
00:17:44,517 --> 00:17:46,018
Not anything about anything you said.

540
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:47,821
But, Charles, didn't you just
tell me you fired someone?

541
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:49,722
Yeah, Ted. I took him out to dinner.

542
00:17:49,756 --> 00:17:50,990
He thought he was getting a promotion.

543
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:52,244
It was a whole thing.

544
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:53,727
He wept a lot. Not as much as me...

545
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,440
Yeah, but the point is,
he was upset, right?

546
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,205
And he knew where you liked
to park the truck.

547
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,134
Uh-huh. And he never gave me
my key back.

548
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,136
He said he lost it.
You really think it's him?

549
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:03,441
I mean, it's just a hunch, but...

550
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:04,871
We should go to his house
and burn it down.

551
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:06,139
I was gonna say we could go investigate.

552
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,407
Sure, sure, sure.

553
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,608
And then burn it to the ground.

554
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:10,177
No. No burning of anything!

555
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:11,691
What? I already got the match lit.

556
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:13,611
- How?
- Let's hurry up and get there.

557
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:16,656
Captain, I'm trying
to get your account reinstated,

558
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:17,785
but it could take a while.

559
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:19,437
They say they have a lot of Nazi stuff

560
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:20,453
on the front burner.

561
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:21,462
And when you tweet again,

562
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:23,657
you should probably stop
communicating in numbers, kay?

563
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:25,625
There's a 0% chance of that.

564
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:26,893
Besides, I won't be tweeting anymore.

565
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:28,529
I just got off the phone with the head

566
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:29,897
- of the selection committee.
- You did?

567
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:31,899
Apparently, one of
the candidates for commissioner

568
00:18:31,931 --> 00:18:34,066
tweeted a picture
of the water main break

569
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,836
and accidentally included a link

570
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:37,538
to his favorite pornographic website...

571
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:39,006
- Mm.
- Cosplay-butts-n-boobs.com.

572
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:40,039
Amateur move.

573
00:18:40,073 --> 00:18:42,141
You should never copy-paste
if you're a perv.

574
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:44,645
It's quite the scandal.
The candidate has dropped out.

575
00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:45,946
It's down to just three of us now.

576
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:48,582
So I guess this proves
I was right all along.

577
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:50,450
Social media... it's a fool's game,

578
00:18:50,484 --> 00:18:51,818
and only a fool would play.

579
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:52,867
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

580
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,771
And why is Cheddar wearing a beret?

581
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:58,806
Uh...

582
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,974
Kevin saw your photos and was amused,

583
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:03,545
so we started an Instagram
account for Cheddar,

584
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:06,047
who now has over 14,000 followers.

585
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,349
Hoo-whee!

586
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:08,949
It's an incredible feeling.

587
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,551
<i>This is insulting.</i>

588
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:12,053
First you fire me in front of my family.

589
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:13,688
Ooh, Charles,
his family was at the dinner?

590
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:14,756
It was not well-handled.

591
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:15,790
Now you accuse me of arson.

592
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:16,957
Just get out of my garage.

593
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:18,393
<i>Hey, Ted?</i>

594
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:19,961
How come you have all this turpentine?

595
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,597
And this plastic bag filled with
matches and magnesium strips.

596
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:23,964
I found it buried under the back porch,

597
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,899
and I'm no expert, but it seems like

598
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:28,936
that's the kind of stuff you'd
use to light a fire, right?

599
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,039
Oh, there he goes.

600
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:35,843
Say it with me, Jake.

601
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:36,778
You've been...

602
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,512
- Denied!
- Butt-slammed!

603
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,814
- Wait, what?
- Denied, like the stamp?

604
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,784
Oh, that is so much better.

605
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:45,954
"Butt-slammed" is so stupid.

606
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:48,656
Oh, is that the wedding dress

607
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,992
from the Erica Somerfield
2018 fall collection?

608
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,026
No way, the bodice is totally different.

609
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,963
Why do you two know so much
about wedding dresses?

610
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,663
They're the only thing
you can look at around here

611
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,831
with safe search on!

612
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,434
<i>All right, that's enough.</i>

613
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:00,734
Can we all get back to police work

614
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,737
and stop talking about wedding dresses?

615
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,472
No. We're gonna talk about them,

616
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,006
because while wearing a wedding dress,

617
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,474
you leapt over a couch,

618
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:09,077
sprinted down an alley,
and jumped off a car

619
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:11,612
to subdue the crap out of a perp
like you were Wonder Woman.

620
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:12,946
It was pretty cool, wasn't it?

621
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,683
Amy, you are an amazing cop
and a great leader,

622
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,685
and you have proven that
a billion times over.

623
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,420
You can't let other people's
opinions get in the way

624
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:21,156
of what you want, especially
because other people suck.

625
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:22,756
Well, if I'm being honest,

626
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,058
- I would like a prettier dress.
- There you go.

627
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,659
And I would like it to have some lace.

628
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:26,895
- Uh-huh.
- And a sweetheart neckline,

629
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:28,629
- thank you very much.
- What else?

630
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:30,432
And I want a mermaid cut
with tulip sleeves.

631
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:31,765
Say it again. Say it loud.

632
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,570
A mermaid cut
with tulip frickin' sleeves!

633
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,504
Pimento's here! All right!

634
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:38,772
Thanks so much for that text, man.

635
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:40,074
- That meant a lot.
- The one that said,

636
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:41,843
- "Want to grab a drink tonight?"
- Yeah.

637
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,677
Hey, Boyle, did you get
that insurance payout?

638
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:45,180
Yes, I am out
of the food truck business,

639
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:47,303
and I no longer start
spontaneously weeping.

640
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:49,851
- Nice.
- Listen, I'm sorry you got fired.

641
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:51,752
Oh, don't worry about it.
I got myself fired, all right?

642
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,154
Plus, doesn't matter.
I got a way better job now.

643
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,925
I'm working at one of those
fancy hand lotion stores.

644
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:58,792
Spoiler alert: I have a gun again,

645
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:00,995
and I've gotten to use it three times.

646
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,531
You would be surprised
how often teenage girls

647
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,286
try and shoplift mango hand cream.

648
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:07,535
- Huh.
- But it smells great!

649
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:08,837
- I love it.
- I can get you some.

650
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,671
Well, listen, man,
I've got something for you.

651
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:11,806
Really? For me?

652
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,840
It's an invitation to my wedding.

653
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:15,176
Aw, Jake, I am so honored

654
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,217
and would love to be...

655
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,879
oh, nope, I can't make this.

656
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,514
This is the same night as Lady Gaga.

657
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:20,748
Oh, thank God. I didn't run it by Amy,

658
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,250
so this worked out great for both of us!

659
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,618
But honestly,

660
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,785
nobody's gonna come to this,

661
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,221
because everybody's gonna be at Gaga.

662
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:27,789

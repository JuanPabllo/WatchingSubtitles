1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,735
- _
- I'll get back to you guys

2
00:00:01,738 --> 00:00:04,011
by the end of the day
with all the logistics.

3
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,183
Sergeant Terrance Jeffords,

4
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:08,355
four years ago on this exact date,

5
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:11,096
you told me I was too old
to learn how to do the worm.

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,268
I vowed on that day to prove you a fool,

7
00:00:13,302 --> 00:00:17,145
and today, I shall.

8
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:20,319
Check it.

9
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:27,439
I'm on fire!

10
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:32,183
As I was telling the
squad, our old C.O.,

11
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:34,189
Captain McGintley, just passed away.

12
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:36,093
Oh, no.

13
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:37,830
We're going to Los Angeles
for the funeral next week.

14
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:39,469
I'll have the travel details later.

15
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:41,240
Hey, has anyone seen a worm?

16
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:43,944
Because this funky chicken's hungry.

17
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:46,320
Charles, a man has died. Read the room!

18
00:00:56,413 --> 00:01:01,413
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

19
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:10,213
- _
- Oh, man. Sad day.

20
00:01:10,247 --> 00:01:11,415
Sad day.

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,552
It's crazy how different things were

22
00:01:12,587 --> 00:01:14,257
when McGintley was Captain.

23
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,726
It was like the Wild West.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,732
- Oh, yeah, we had some fun.
- I didn't.

25
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:21,209
In every one of those photos,
I look uptight and worried.

26
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:22,411
Meanwhile, everyone else looks like

27
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:23,781
they're having the time of their life.

28
00:01:23,814 --> 00:01:25,551
That's because they're all stress-free,

29
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,989
not like us Type A's.

30
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:28,759
Jake, am I too high-strung?

31
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,232
I wouldn't say you're too high-strung.

32
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:31,768
You just are high-strung.

33
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,439
You know, your strung
is what makes you strung.

34
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:35,444
- You're strung strongly.
- No, not anymore.

35
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:38,451
From now on, I'm gonna be super chill.

36
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:40,023
So, where's the party at?

37
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:42,997
Trick question. The
party's right here, boy!

38
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:46,272
Oh, hello, Mrs. McGintley.

39
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:48,543
My condolences for your loss.

40
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:51,585
So, who do you got your eye on?

41
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:53,355
- What?
- You haven't dated anyone

42
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,492
since you broke up with Pimento.

43
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:56,498
And funerals are a meat market.

44
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:58,637
Sadness is a powerful aphrodisiac.

45
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,313
- No, it's not.
- Then how come everyone cries during sex?

46
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:03,346
I'm already seeing somebody, Boyle.

47
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:04,686
Oh...

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,557
And just like that,
things got interesting.

49
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,530
And just like that, I left.

50
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,667
- Hello, Raymond.
- Oh, Chief Aggerton.

51
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,538
I didn't realize you'd
be flying out for this.

52
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:14,712
I liked McGintley. He was
fun to have a beer with.

53
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:16,449
There's nobody in this department

54
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:17,685
I wanna have a beer with anymore.

55
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:19,556
Yes, that's the problem with the NYPD.

56
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:20,927
So, I hear you're meeting with

57
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:22,498
the Commissioner on Monday morning.

58
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:23,935
Well, you didn't hear this from me,

59
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:25,905
but Commissioner's retiring next year.

60
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,510
They put a short list together
of possible replacements,

61
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:28,914
and you're on it.

62
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:30,418
- This is your first interview.
- Really?

63
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,122
- What?
- Oh, my God.

64
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:33,726
- What's going on?
- What's going on is

65
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,929
Captain Holt has an interview
to become the Commissioner

66
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:36,601
of the freakin' NYPD,

67
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,504
and he's gonna nail it
and fulfill his destiny

68
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:40,143
as Lord High Commander of all Justice.

69
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:41,781
Okay, let's not get carried away.

70
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:43,951
Who says I'm even interested
in becoming Commissioner?

71
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:46,758
You, constantly, including
the first day I met you.

72
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,631
I'm interested in becoming Commissioner.

73
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:50,501
- Good to know.
- Fair enough, but even so,

74
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:51,771
it's probably a long shot.

75
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,644
I mean, there are
many names on the list.

76
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:55,181
Nope, just four.

77
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:56,652
Yeah, three major league jags and you.

78
00:02:56,685 --> 00:02:58,021
Sir, you're the perfect candidate:

79
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:59,659
smart, well-respected, you smell great.

80
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:01,497
That has nothing to do with the job.

81
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:02,766
It's just something I've
been meaning to tell you.

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,471
- Is it sandalwood?
- Please calm down.

83
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:05,539
Right, totally. Don't wanna jinx it.

84
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:07,011
I don't believe in jinxes.

85
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:08,112
Great, then you won't
mind me saying it's a lock.

86
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:09,565
You're definitely gonna get it,
and you're gonna smell even better

87
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,363
with that Lord High Commander
of all Justice stank on you.

88
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:12,501
Let's do this

89
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:14,925
- _
- I can't wait to get on a plane.

90
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,210
I used up my miles, and
upgraded first class.

91
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,317
- Damn, Sarge.
- This is gonna be great.

92
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:22,411
Sipping on a mimosa,
snacking on a hummus trio,

93
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,260
watching "Bridget Jones's Baby."

94
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:26,572
- Oh, GPS says turn left here.
- Turn left.

95
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:28,199
No, this route is more direct.

96
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:29,749
Oh, okay. You do you, Commish.

97
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:31,248
- Please don't call me that.
- Okay, fine,

98
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:33,440
I'll just call you the 'Mish...
no wait, Mishy Elliot...

99
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,116
no wait, Mish-es Doubtfire. Oh, my God!

100
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:40,608
- What? What is it?
- Nakatomi Plaza.

101
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,906
It's the most important
monument in all of America.

102
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:45,817
The building from "Die
Hard." Can we go in?

103
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,505
- Can we pay our respects?
- Ooh, our flight leaves in 3 and a half hours, and...

104
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:53,062
but it's like, what is time even?

105
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:54,875
#LegalizeIt.

106
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,780
- Can we go in, sir?
- Fine, just make it quick.

107
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:59,381
Yes! Pull in over there, Argyle!

108
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:01,449
- What?
- That's the name of the driver in the movie.

109
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:03,371
We're going to Nakatomi Plaza.
There's gonna be role-play.

110
00:04:03,437 --> 00:04:06,005
Oh, my God.

111
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,315
It's even more beautiful
than I imagined.

112
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:10,114
It's an empty floor
that's under construction.

113
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,253
Just like in the movie!

114
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:14,068
Charles, this is the floor that John
McClane ran on with his bare feet.

115
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:15,440
Take my picture with it!

116
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,251
This is the window
where John McClane said,

117
00:04:19,282 --> 00:04:21,514
"Welcome to the party, pal."
Take my picture with it!

118
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:22,764
This is the vent where
John McClane said,

119
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,354
"Come out to the coast. We'll
get together, have a few laughs."

120
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,017
Take my picture with it. This
is the space, where even though

121
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:27,155
it's not really evident in the dialogue,

122
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:28,472
you can tell that John McClane realizes

123
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,734
that he should've been a better
husband. Take my picture with it!

124
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,368
Take my picture with it!
Take my picture with it!

125
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,792
Take my picture with it! But
then he unclasps the watch,

126
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:37,927
and Hans falls!

127
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:40,286
That's a good one. That's a good one,

128
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:41,363
That's a good one. That's a good one...

129
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:43,579
That's a good one. Okay,
all 600 of these are great.

130
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:45,677
- We should probably head to the airport.
- We have more time, if you need it.

131
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,497
There's literally nothing
left for me to shoot.

132
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:48,931
All right, let's get out of here.

133
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:51,528
The door is locked.

134
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,256
That's strange, I thought
the guard propped it open.

135
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:55,325
I'd kick my way out, but I think
these windows are bullet-proof.

136
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:57,445
We're not getting any reception in here.

137
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:59,931
Guys, it's cool. We
just gotta roll with it.

138
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:02,157
- You know, travel should be like jazz.
- Nuh-uh.

139
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:03,815
There's a lie-flat seat waiting for me,

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,126
and I wanna be napping in it,

141
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:07,602
with a hot towel wrapped
around my big bald head!

142
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:10,093
- Help!
- All right, everybody just calm down.

143
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,782
I'm sure that guard will be
back in, like, five minutes.

144
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:14,140
- _
- We're gonna miss our flight.

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,127
I should be sitting next
to a semi-famous person

146
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:17,769
that I can't quite place right now.

147
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:20,031
Come on, don't give up.
If we get rescued right now

148
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,426
and there's no traffic at the airport

149
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:22,791
and the van return goes smoothly

150
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,722
and Security's super chill
about all the guns we have,

151
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:26,242
we could still make it.

152
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:29,226
- You guys okay up here?
- Yes! See?

153
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:31,620
I told you not to give
up hope. It's a miracle.

154
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,319
- We're still gonna make it!
- Yeah, we missed our flight by a lot.

155
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:35,930
Yeah, but that's okay.
We can get the next one.

156
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,968
Let's see, next flight...
Cancelled. Cancelled.

157
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:41,586
- Cancelled. What is going on?
- There are huge storms in the Midwest.

158
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:43,822
- All flights are grounded.
- Oh, man.

159
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:45,576
I know this is the wrong
time to bring it up,

160
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:47,468
but we're standing 75
feet from where Argyle

161
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,470
picked up John McClane at the airport.

162
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,107
- Take my picture with it.
- Yeah.

163
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:56,732
Okay, we can't get out until
Monday afternoon, at the earliest.

164
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:59,636
I tried everything. I begged.
I pleaded. I even told them

165
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,459
that Scully was a Make-a-Wish
kid with a rare disease

166
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:02,920
that makes him look
like a giant old baby.

167
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:04,903
- Did you call it Scullyosis?
- Damn it, Rosa,

168
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:06,866
that's really good and
completely useless to me now.

169
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:08,859
They wouldn't even let me
into a first class lounge,

170
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,257
since my flight had already departed.

171
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:11,716
I grabbed this and ran.

172
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:14,753
You're all that's left of
my dreams now, Mr. Mint.

173
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:17,518
All right, stop hugging your
mint. We have bigger problems.

174
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,505
Captain Holt's Commissioners
interview is on Monday.

175
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:21,223
- Can't he just reschedule?
- No!

176
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:22,910
He's gonna be up against
the best of the best.

177
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:25,010
The slightest slipup could
cost him the job, and...

178
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:27,775
but whatever, you know.

179
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,259
It is what it is, Daddy-O.

180
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,819
Look, Captain Holt helped us all achieve

181
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,888
our collective dream of
going to Nakatomi Plaza.

182
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:34,077
- Only you.
- Now it's time for us

183
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:36,080
to return the favor and
help him achieve his.

184
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,869
Get him back to New York
in time for that interview.

185
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,619
Now, we have until Monday
morning, and it takes...

186
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,166
48 hours to drive from L.A. to New York.

187
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:44,863
- We've still got time.
- No, we don't.

188
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:46,561
I checked with all the
car rental agencies.

189
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,994
There are no available vehicles.

190
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:49,900
I'm just gonna have to call the
Commissioner, cancel this meeting.

191
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,258
No, not on my watch.

192
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:53,815
We just have to think. There's
gotta be a way to get you back.

193
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,863
Got it! May I present
to you the finest RV

194
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:01,570
that not much money can
buy: The American Creeper.

195
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:03,381
No one should have to
suffer like this for me.

196
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,580
Suffer? This is a dream come true.

197
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:06,986
It's a cross-country road trip.

198
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,675
My dad and I took one every summer.

199
00:07:08,756 --> 00:07:10,529
You blast the "Annie" soundtrack,

200
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:11,989
and you eat junk food,

201
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,779
and you bond over secrets.

202
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:15,668
I'm not telling you who I'm dating.

203
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,081
All right, I'll take the first shift.

204
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:19,617
American Creepers, let's get creeping!

205
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:28,966
- _
- Hey, one hour down.

206
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:31,503
Victory honk.

207
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,709
Oh, no. Oh, boy.

208
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,464
Horn's stuck.

209
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,915
Nobody use the horn.

210
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:41,541
_

211
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:42,914
What you got there, Sarge?

212
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,536
I microwaved a bunch of wet
napkins to make a hot towel.

213
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,071
Just because we're in a crappy RV

214
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,674
doesn't mean I still
can't be First Class Terry.

215
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,717
Mmm...

216
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:53,969
Ah...

217
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:55,550
Just like the real thing.

218
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,115
_

219
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,299
Cheese puff, sir?

220
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:00,164
No, thank you. They're
full of chemicals.

221
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:02,350
Well, yes, but everything's
made with chemicals,

222
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,524
if you really think about it.

223
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:04,754
- I suppose you're right.
- I am?

224
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,949
- Let me try one.
- Oh.

225
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:10,568
- It imploded in my mouth.
- That's the magic of the puff.

226
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:11,950
You don't have to chew.

227
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,982
So, what are you gonna
do when you're Commish?

228
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:17,443
I think you should focus on interagency
communication and intel sharing.

229
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:19,381
Also, laser jails.

230
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:22,100
Let's not talk about
things that may not happen.

231
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:24,489
Oh, I'd like to see an
increase in vacation days.

232
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,439
And we should all get
summers off like teachers.

233
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,754
- Let the city go to purge.
- _

234
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,747
Hey, Rosa, are you
ready to go streaking?

235
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,322
- What?
- That's what my dad and I called

236
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:33,766
getting blonde streaks in your hair.

237
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:36,088
We used to do it to our
ponytails on road trips.

238
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,807
You just take a little lemon up top,

239
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,367
and let the sun do the rest.

240
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:41,258
We called it giving
each other road head.

241
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:43,011
You just said you called
it going streaking.

242
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:44,211
It had a couple names.

243
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:46,508
Hey, speaking of names...

244
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:49,737
who's your new boyfriend? Ow! Ow! Oh!

245
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,216
_

246
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,587
Oh, man, you really went to
town on these cheese puffs.

247
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:55,372
Well, they're 80% air,

248
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:56,960
which is something your body needs.

249
00:08:56,979 --> 00:08:59,732
Dallas? What the hell? We were
supposed to be in Louisiana by now.

250
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:01,937
We've been averaging 50 for 21 hours.

251
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:03,354
Unless...

252
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,016
Damn it! The speedometer's broken.

253
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:08,631
No wonder everyone was flipping us
off. I thought it was just racism.

254
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:10,264
- Well, I'm sure it didn't help.
- Yeah.

255
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:11,813
I'm sorry, I don't think
we can make up the time.

256
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:13,700
No, there's no way I'm letting
you miss that interview.

257
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:15,244
We just have to make less stops.

258
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:17,906
Hey, guys, listen up, from now on,

259
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,454
we use the bathroom in the RV.

260
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,189
- No!
- There are so many of us.

261
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,318
- I know, I'm sorry, but it's the only way.
- Me first!

262
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:27,910
Hey, guys, the door
doesn't close all the way.

263
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,613
No peeking.

264
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:32,441
_

265
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:34,913
- You guys didn't hear that, did you?
- I'm still hearing it.

266
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,382
- I'm never gonna stop hearing it!
- Okay, new plan:

267
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:39,384
we go back to the old
bathroom break schedule,

268
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:42,771
and we just drive at max speed.
Captain, punch it. Punch it.

269
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,761
- Why are you not punching it?
- I'm not comfortable

270
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:46,699
operating this vehicle
at a speed greater

271
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,414
than the prevailing road
and traffic conditions.

272
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:51,096
Fine! I'll do it myself.
This is going great.

273
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,301
I'm already used to the
bouncing and shaking.

274
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:55,023
- I smell smoke.
- Really?

275
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,782
All I smell is residual Scully.

276
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:58,319
I definitely smell smoke.

277
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:00,543
Pull over right now.

278
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:02,221
Well, I checked everywhere.

279
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:04,889
Nothing's on fire.
Nothing's even smoldering.

280
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:07,138
We just wasted ten
minutes for no reason.

281
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:15,290
You know what, Captain,
I think you're right.

282
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:17,506
I do smell smoke.

283
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:19,807
So, bottom-line this thing for me.

284
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,637
How long is it gonna take to fix?

285
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:24,414
- It's still on fire.
- She's gone, Jakey.

286
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,008
She's creeping her way to heaven.

287
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:28,175
Let's be honest, she's
creeping her way back to hell.

288
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,133
All right, guys, we have to
focus and think of a new plan

289
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,582
for getting Holt back for his interview.

290
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:35,204
Now, all we've lost is our
only mode of transportation.

291
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,673
And our clothes and food!

292
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,716
All I have left is
this first class mint,

293
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:39,947
and none of you get to eat him!

294
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:41,363
Well, perhaps we should just focus on

295
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:42,710
finding a place to sleep tonight.

296
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:44,214
I might have a solution for that.

297
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,724
How far is it to Mansfurd, Texas?

298
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:47,407
- Like, half an hour.
- Great!

299
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,760
I have cousins there:
Becca, Tommy, and Steve.

300
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:52,936
- There's a Boyle in every state.
- Texas Boyles. I'm excited.

301
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:55,141
Do they wear bolo ties and cowboy hats?

302
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:57,321
Nope, still just beige on tan.

303
00:10:57,372 --> 00:11:00,250
- Steve, Tommy, Becca!
- Becca is a man.

304
00:11:00,256 --> 00:11:02,632
Oh, thank you so much
for letting us stay here.

305
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:04,112
- I love you.
- I love you.

306
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,771
- I love you.
- I love you.

307
00:11:05,804 --> 00:11:07,893
God, it is so nice to meet you guys!

308
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:10,028
Is this a working cattle ranch?

309
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:12,010
Oh, yes. This is a stud farm.

310
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:15,702
We are the cow insemination
kings of Central Texas.

311
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:16,654
Of course you are.

312
00:11:16,663 --> 00:11:19,094
We have sleeping bags for you
guys here in the great room.

313
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:20,445
If you hear what sounds like screaming,

314
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,044
that's just cow intercourse.

315
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:24,950
Now we're all sleeping in one room,

316
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:27,969
- next to a cow orgy.
- I would much rather be hanging out with you.

317
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:30,111
- What are you doing, Boyle?
- Just brushing my hair.

318
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:32,627
Not you, Becca. I was
talking to Charles.

319
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:34,247
- I was just bringing you some water.
- Thanks.

320
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:36,245
Mm-hm. So, uh,

321
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,324
who you talking to? Is
that your mystery hunk?

322
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:39,980
Babe, are you all right?
Is everything okay?

323
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:41,256
Yeah, it's fine. I'll
call you back later.

324
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:43,199
- Was that a woman's voice?
- It's my sister.

325
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:45,448
Wait... she called you babe.

326
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,808
When my cousin called me babe,

327
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:48,406
you said relatives shouldn't do that.

328
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:50,576
What's really going on?

329
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:52,980
I'm dating a woman.

330
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,010
- I'm bi.
- Oh...

331
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:57,463
That's great.

332
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:01,285
That's great, Rose. I just want you
to know that I totally support...

333
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:03,292
I don't wanna talk
about it right now, okay?

334
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:05,737
- Just leave it alone, Boyle.
- By all means.

335
00:12:05,777 --> 00:12:07,327
Not you, Becca!

336
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,625
Okay. I love you.

337
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,023
I love you too.

338
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:18,379
Can't sleep either, huh?

339
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,232
- This cow screaming is so loud.
- So loud.

340
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:23,925
Is it a pleasure sound or pain?

341
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,153
- Maybe they're into both?
- I hear they're into leather.

342
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,176
- Was that a joke?
- Gallows humor.

343
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:32,023
Being in this bovine
brothel is truly a nightmare.

344
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:34,363
Hey, I'm sorry that
things didn't work out.

345
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:36,367
I know you always hoped
that you'd be Commissioner.

346
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,272
No. Over the course of my career,

347
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:40,587
I've learned that it's
best not to have hopes.

348
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,697
Sir, that is so sad.

349
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:44,635
That's like saying it's
best not to have dreams.

350
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,271
I only have one dream a
year, always on Tax Day.

351
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:49,110
In it, I must file an extension.

352
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:51,841
So, yes, it is best not to have dreams.

353
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:54,666
Well, I still wish I
could've got you back in time.

354
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:56,323
Why do you care so much about this?

355
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,431
I don't know,

356
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,916
it's your dream, and, you know,

357
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:04,198
you changed my life, made me
wanna be a better man, or whatever.

358
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,470
Thank you for trying.

359
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:08,186
But deep down,

360
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:10,258
I always knew I'd never be Commissioner.

361
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,053
All my dreams start with my
step-sister painting her house.

362
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,505
And they end with the
house looking great?

363
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,025
No. Sex.

364
00:13:25,593 --> 00:13:27,887
Guys! Guys! Wake up, wake up, wake up.

365
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,514
- Up, up, up! Come on!
- What's going on?

366
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:32,728
Captain Holt, I know you've given
up on your future, but I haven't.

367
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:35,689
- You're going to that interview.
- It's too late, Peralta.

368
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:37,118
Just put a sock in it, man!

369
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,560
I'm doing this because of
how much I care about you,

370
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:39,953
so just stay the hell out of the way!

371
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,438
But we're too late to drive,

372
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,481
- and there's no available flights.
- That's what I thought,

373
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:45,905
but on the way here, we
passed the town of Jacksboro.

374
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,227
I knew I recognized it from somewhere.

375
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:48,737
Where? Sorry, are you monologuing,

376
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,713
- or is this a call-and-response thing?
- No, that was great.

377
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:52,677
Now, I order a lot of beef jerky online,

378
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,387
'cause I'm a cool guy
with cool interests,

379
00:13:54,412 --> 00:13:56,605
and it's always shipped
from Jacksboro, Texas.

380
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,054
There's a huge fulfillment center there.

381
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,465
- There is?
- Yes, Charles.

382
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:00,812
I called them, and
they ship their packages

383
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:02,852
- out of a regional airport.
- They do?

384
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,409
That's too much. Maybe
back off a little bit.

385
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,544
Passenger planes don't
fly out of Jacksboro,

386
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:08,285
but thing planes do!

387
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:10,044
- You mean cargo planes?
- Yes, thank you.

388
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,785
- Terry gets to interject?
- The point is,

389
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:14,327
we get to fly on the back of
a cargo plane to Philadelphia.

390
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:15,660
When do we have to be in Jacksboro?

391
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,414
In an hour and a half,
so get up and get ready.

392
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:19,651
Well, we've been in these clothes
since Friday. We smell like butt.

393
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:21,945
- And all our stuff exploded.
- Right, good point.

394
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:24,050
Uh, I guess we'll just
have to borrow some.

395
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:25,626
Oh, no. From who?

396
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,949
We look so cool right now.

397
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,053
I feel like we're in
a Mervyn's commercial.

398
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,849
Yeah, Mervyn's!

399
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:44,436
Is this cattle trailer safe?

400
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:46,322
Who cares, it's fun.

401
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:48,955
Yeah, it's terrifying,

402
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:51,679
but it doesn't matter, because
we're almost to the airport.

403
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:54,185
What? No, why?

404
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,883
Just because we're eight people
standing in the back of a cattle car?

405
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:58,772
Nah, I don't care about that.

406
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:00,772
We got a tip saying there
were drugs being moved

407
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:03,984
in the back of a gray
bovine transport unit.

408
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,624
Well, this is terrible.

409
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,525
Wait a minute, who called this tip in?

410
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:11,070
- It's impossible to say.
- They said the drugs were

411
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:12,674
in the back of a bovine transport unit.

412
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:15,407
- Who calls it that?
- Everyone. That's what they're called.

413
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:18,583
Yeah, if you're a robot,

414
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,899
and you're the only robot I know, sir.

415
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:23,243
Bovine. Transport. Unit.

416
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,337
- Meep-morp. Zeep.
- This is preposterous.

417
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:27,821
- What are you implying?
- Let me see your phone.

418
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:29,106
- I wanna see your call history.
- No.

419
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:30,103
- Let me see it!
- No...

420
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,546
- no! Get away!
- Give it to me!

421
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,079
Guys, come on. Break it up!

422
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:35,409
Ah-ha!

423
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:38,707
25 minutes ago, outgoing call to 911.

424
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:40,700
You sabotaged us, Mr. Robot!

425
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:43,526
Not the TV show, but the
point is, you sabotaged us!

426
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:45,543
Terry, would you do the honors?

427
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:47,333
Why?

428
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:49,102
You called the pigs on us?

429
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:50,240
I don't know how this happened.

430
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:52,059
- Perhaps it was a bottom dial.
- Liar.

431
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,036
The reason you said you knew
you'd never become Commissioner

432
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:55,215
is 'cause you were making sure of it.

433
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:57,025
You've been sabotaging
us from the beginning.

434
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:58,112
Oh, please.

435
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:00,278
You drove by Nakatomi Plaza
on purpose, didn't you?

436
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:03,148
You knew I would see it and go
insane and have to go inside,

437
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,779
and then you trapped
us in there, didn't you?

438
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,699
- Didn't you?
- Fine. I did.

439
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,808
Over here is the elevator where McClane

440
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:12,118
put the "now I have a
machine gun, ho, ho, ho" down.

441
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,557
Take my picture with it!

442
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,810
And there were plenty of rental
cars at the airport, weren't there?

443
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:18,437
- Hundreds.
- And you broke the speedometer. And what else?

444
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:20,430
Did you somehow force
Scully to stink up the RV

445
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,711
- so we'd have to stop more often?
- It wasn't difficult.

446
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,029
Three corndogs for 99 cents?

447
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:29,575
Who could possibly eat three
corndogs and has a dollar?

448
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:32,708
Oh, my God.

449
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,376
- Did you blow up the Creeper?
- Not on purpose.

450
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:39,220
Once I realized your
revolting cheese puffs

451
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,685
were made with some
extremely unstable chemicals,

452
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:43,333
I deposited a few in the gas tank.

453
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:44,659
I thought they'd shut the engine down.

454
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:46,454
I didn't realize they'd ignite it.

455
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:50,203
- You really shouldn't eat those, Peralta.
- Don't tell me what to do, saboteur.

456
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,623
How dare you make me this upset
while I'm wearing this outfit?

457
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:54,758
Look, we've been busting
our asses the whole weekend

458
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:56,938
to try and get you back to
New York in time, and for what?

459
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,391
Is it all just a lie?

460
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,887
Is there even a Commissioners
meeting. Are you even Captain Holt?

461
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:03,281
- Do you even have a dog named Cheddar?
- There's a Commissioners meeting,

462
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:04,582
and I do have a dog named Cheddar.

463
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,863
Then why'd you do it?

464
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:09,522
I'm compromised.

465
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:11,291
I made a decision a while ago,

466
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:13,689
and now some people are
holding it over my head.

467
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:16,881
I'm afraid of what they'll ask
me to do if I become Commissioner.

468
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:18,720
You're compromised?

469
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:22,456
How did this happen, Mr. Prevailing
Traffic and Road Conditions?

470
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:23,476
It doesn't matter.

471
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:25,049
Seamus Murphy.

472
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,756
- What?
- Seamus Murphy, the gangster.

473
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,583
He offered me info that would
get you and Rosa out of prison,

474
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:32,097
in exchange for a favor.

475
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:34,969
And Holt told me to turn it down,
because he said it was too risky.

476
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,128
But you didn't turn it
down, did you, Captain?

477
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,806
No, I did not.

478
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:41,530
- Wait...
- So you risked everything

479
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:43,004
to get me and Rosa out of prison?

480
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:46,700
Oh, my God. You did all of this for us?

481
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:51,402
I love you, Da... aptain... Daptain.

482
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:52,739
It's the cool new way of saying Captain.

483
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,944
It's from the world
of hip-hop. Love you.

484
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:57,378
Sir, why didn't you tell us?

485
00:17:57,546 --> 00:17:59,813
I didn't want any of
you entangled in this.

486
00:17:59,938 --> 00:18:00,997
This is my decision,

487
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:03,224
and it's also my responsibility.

488
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:04,490
Sir,

489
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:06,049
with all due respect,

490
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,286
the first thing that you taught me

491
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:09,299
when you came to the
Nine-Nine is that we're a team,

492
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:12,399
so your responsibility
is my responsibility too.

493
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:14,483
- And mine.
- And mine.

494
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:16,222
- And mine.
- And mine.

495
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:17,381
And mine.

496
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:20,079
Six people seems like a
lot. I mean, at some point,

497
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:21,518
it's just too many cooks.

498
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:24,623
- And mine.
- You're gonna take that meeting,

499
00:18:24,748 --> 00:18:27,508
you're gonna get the job, and
you're gonna become Commissioner,

500
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,481
and we'll all figure out
what to do about Murphy.

501
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,812
I'm touched...

502
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,001
But it's moved. We've
missed the cargo plane.

503
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,684
And now there's no
way to get back in time

504
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:37,317
- for me to make my meeting.
- Nuh-uh.

505
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:38,763
- Amy?
- What up, bro?

506
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:40,959
I need you to climb back
on that strungness ladder,

507
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:42,634
and I need you to climb pretty high.

508
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,123
- How high?
- Remember that time

509
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:45,536
we went to the deli for cold cuts,

510
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:46,700
and the ticket machine was broken,

511
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,310
so you found out what
time everyone arrived

512
00:18:48,312 --> 00:18:49,588
and made them get in a single-file line

513
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:51,845
- from earliest to latest?
- Yeah.

514
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:52,998
Higher.

515
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:54,620
Copy that.

516
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,096
You might wanna stand
back for this, sir.

517
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:01,947
It can get pretty intense.

518
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:04,310
All right, you mooks,
our union health plan

519
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:06,939
has 100% reimbursement for
out-of-state ambulance rides.

520
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,625
Scully will fake a medical emergency.

521
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:10,775
Don't need to fake it.
Always having at least one.

522
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,957
Great. You call an ambulance,

523
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:14,014
and have it take us here
to Monroe, Louisiana.

524
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,657
The ambulance can drive 25 miles
over the posted speed limit,

525
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:18,483
so we'll get there by 9:00 p.m.

526
00:19:18,552 --> 00:19:20,873
There's a small airport there,
mostly servicing crop dusters.

527
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:22,264
Of course, they can't take passengers,

528
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:25,395
but thanks to a loophole in H.R. 377551,

529
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:27,518
police officers are allowed
to commandeer any plane

530
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:28,786
in the interest of national security.

531
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,600
The crop duster will land at an airstrip

532
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:33,169
outside of Finksburg, Maryland.
We'll take a cab to Baltimore,

533
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,060
jump on the 6:48 a.m. train to New York,

534
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:36,206
arriving at 9:26.

535
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:38,562
Kevin will meet us at Penn Station
with a fresh Captain's uniform.

536
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,179
From there, it's a 29-minute
cab ride to One Police Plaza.

537
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,756
You change on the way, and
we should get to your meeting

538
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:44,769
with five minutes to spare.

539
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,229
Stop clapping, you idiots!
We gotta move, move, move!

540
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:52,293
I love her.

541
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,371
_

542
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:02,831
Yes! We did it!

543
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:04,458
I can't believe we did it!

544
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,704
Peralta, thank you

545
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:08,590
for not quitting on me.

546
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:11,131
Of course, sir. Go get 'em.

547
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:13,267
Wait, wait! Just one more thing.

548
00:20:14,437 --> 00:20:16,078
Your first class mint?

549
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,289
I know how important this is to you.

550
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,423
You know what really
makes a trip first class?

551
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:22,050
It's not the extra leg room

552
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,986
- or the complimentary drinks...
- Actually, Terry,

553
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:25,226
we don't really have time
for a speech right now.

554
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:27,239
Fine, your breath sucks!
Just pop it and go!

555
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,515
It's good to be home.

556
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:32,423
Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh!

557
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:35,235
- Drink this instead.
- A mimosa!

558
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:37,198
Made with First Class Champagne.

559
00:20:37,451 --> 00:20:39,499
That's the brand name.
It's from Arkansas.

560
00:20:39,534 --> 00:20:40,759
I hope it's good.

561
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,728
- Hell yeah!
- Really?

562
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:46,164
No, it's terrible, but I
really appreciate the thought.

563
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:47,189
Oh, I'll take it.

564
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:48,685
- Hey.
- Hey.

565
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:51,536
So, I didn't say
anything about being bi,

566
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:53,416
because I didn't think
it was anybody's business.

567
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,810
And I also didn't want
anything to change.

568
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:57,945
I get it. I'm sorry I was so nosy.

569
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,036
It actually felt really good to
tell somebody on the squad, finally.

570
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:04,014
- I'm glad it was you.
- All right.

571
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,722
Also, now we go back to never
talking about my love life again.

572
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:10,510
Uh, request denied. Is her
name Anne? Meredith? Kim?

573
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:12,539
- Erica? Moana?
- Captain Holt!

574
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:15,049
It's official. My hat is in
the ring for Commissioner.

575
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,226
I still don't know how
we're gonna deal with the

576
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:22,698
- Murphy complication.
- Two words: laser jails.

577
00:21:22,732 --> 00:21:25,240
- But, you know, we'll figure it out.
- Nine-Nine!

578
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:26,663
Nine-Nine!

579
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:29,040
Not a doctor.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

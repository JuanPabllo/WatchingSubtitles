1
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:20,100
Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,164
I'm Philip Davidson.

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,245
Detective Jake Peralta
asked me to drop by.

4
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,050
Mm, the dentist who murdered someone.

5
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:33,220
Spoiler alert: they think you did it.

6
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:36,563
Can you show him to
Interrogation Room C, please?

7
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,501
- Have fun in there.
- Thank you.

8
00:00:43,172 --> 00:00:44,409
What are you smiling about?

9
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,783
How uncomfortable this guy is.

10
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:48,580
Jacked up the thermostat,
got the table all sticky,

11
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,261
made one of the chair legs
too short, and worst of all,

12
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:52,579
I had Gina greet him.

13
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:54,119
- What did you have her do?
- Be herself.

14
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:55,855
- Poor son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:57,091
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?

16
00:00:57,127 --> 00:00:58,796
Kevin and I are attending the opera.

17
00:00:58,832 --> 00:00:59,865
Ooh, the opera.

18
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,203
Is it the one Bugs Bunny sings?

19
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:03,497
- Yes.
- Okay.

20
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:05,706
- So, who's this?
- This is Philip Davidson.

21
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:07,076
- What do we have on him?
- Clear motive,

22
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:09,151
clear means, and a nonexistent alibi,

23
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:10,853
but the DA won't bring a charge

24
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:12,422
because he says it's all circumstantial.

25
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:14,493
We want to bring this guy down,
have to get him to confess

26
00:01:14,528 --> 00:01:16,598
right here, right now.

27
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:19,134
Mm. An interrogation
with a ticking clock

28
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,585
and everything on the line?

29
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,635
I better call Kevin and tell him
I won't be attending the opera.

30
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,612
There's someone else
I'd rather hear sing.

31
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:27,216
- Oh, damn!
- Hello, Kevin.

32
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:28,952
I won't be joining you
at the opera tonight...

33
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:30,726
Oh, sorry, I didn't know you
were on the phone already.

34
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:32,565
- Oh, damn!
- It's under my name, H-O-L...

35
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:51,456
<font color="#741b47">Sync & corrections by </font><font color="#ead1dc">emeline-whovian</font>
<font color="#741b47">www.addic7ed.com</font>

36
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,167
You're right. He did it.

37
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:58,037
But we have no murder weapon,
no witnesses,

38
00:01:58,073 --> 00:02:00,910
and you really didn't find any
usable forensic evidence?

39
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:02,576
The body was discovered
rotting in the Pine Barrens.

40
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:04,982
It'd been rained on for weeks
and chewed up by coyotes.

41
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:06,420
The only other DNA other than the vic's

42
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:08,424
was some bear semen found in the hair.

43
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,983
- Right. Who found the body?
- Hikers.

44
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,122
You're really just gonna blow
past the bear semen detail?

45
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:14,027
I imagine a bear mistook
the rotting corpse

46
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:16,801
for a female of its species
and had intercourse with it.

47
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,136
- Nothing I haven't seen before.
- It isn't?

48
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:20,073
Let's get in here.
Start working this guy.

49
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:22,380
Oh. You're gonna come in with me.

50
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,582
I just thought maybe
you'd watch from out here,

51
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:26,721
you know, pull me out when
I'm getting too hot.

52
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:28,156
Call me a loose cannon.

53
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,591
You know, classic Captain stuff.

54
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:31,027
Peralta, do you know

55
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:32,732
what I miss most about
being a detective?

56
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,667
A good interrogation.

57
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:36,471
Breaking suspects down.

58
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,076
Talking quietly and then
talking real loud.

59
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:42,117
Looking away and then looking
right in their eyes.

60
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:46,454
Leaning.

61
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,493
- That was amazing.
- So, can I join you?

62
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:51,231
Well, a lot of these
techniques do work better

63
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:53,233
with two people:
you know, good cop/bad cop,

64
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:54,636
crazy cop/sane cop,

65
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,639
fast-talking streetwise cop
and Hong Kong cop,

66
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:59,078
AKA the "Rush Hour."
You know what? Let's do this.

67
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,513
Let's break this son of a bitch!

68
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,221
- Hello, Philip.
- Detective.

69
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:06,657
This is Captain Raymond Holt.

70
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:08,627
He's a bit of a legend
in interrogation circles.

71
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:10,565
Hey, Cap, who's the scariest
person you've ever gotten

72
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,277
- a confession out of?
- Connie Buttons.

73
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,504
Okay, thought it was gonna
sound a little cooler,

74
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,642
but no matter.
So, shall we recap the night

75
00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:18,755
that Robert Tupper was murdered
Friday the 22nd?

76
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,996
I believe you were the last person
to see him alive, correct?

77
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:23,962
No. I'd imagine whoever
killed him saw him after I did.

78
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:26,768
Ooh, nice dodge.
You're quick, like a cat.

79
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:29,108
- Like a dancer.
- Like Great Tiger.

80
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:31,417
From "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out."

81
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:32,959
He could teleport around the ring.

82
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:34,128
Most people thought it was
impossible to get past him.

83
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:35,332
I beat him every time.

84
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:36,669
You just punch him when he gets dizzy.

85
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:38,713
Really?! I mean, duh.

86
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:40,151
- Everyone knows that.
- Tell us about Friday.

87
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,588
I had a late afternoon surgery.

88
00:03:41,624 --> 00:03:43,726
Simple gum graft.
It wrapped around 6:00,

89
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:44,995
and then Robert and I talked after.

90
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:46,365
And who else was in the office?

91
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:47,902
Our hygienist and anesthesiologist

92
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:50,348
had gone home, and Grace,
who usually locks up,

93
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:52,657
had left early because her
grandson had a school play.

94
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:54,114
So it was just you and Robert.

95
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,582
- No witnesses?
- That's lucky.

96
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:58,186
It wasn't lucky because
there was nothing to witness.

97
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:00,585
Robert just wanted to talk about firing

98
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,269
one of our office assistants, Cheryl.

99
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:03,891
- And that's all you discussed?
- Yeah.

100
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:05,100
- Nothing else?
- Nah.

101
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:06,529
Zero other subjects were mentioned?

102
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:08,134
- None.
- Not even how gross gum grafts are?

103
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,226
They're really not that gross.

104
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:11,165
Liar! About the gum graft thing,

105
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,235
and about the meeting.

106
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:13,838
We just talked about Cheryl.

107
00:04:14,176 --> 00:04:16,179
Right. And, of course,
there's no way for me

108
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,582
to check if that's true, because

109
00:04:17,618 --> 00:04:19,791
because whoever took Robert's phone
wiped all of his calendars.

110
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:23,725
Except... it was all backed up
on his home laptop.

111
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,285
Would you like to hear what he
said the meeting was about?

112
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:29,408
"7:00 p.m. Talked with Philip about..."

113
00:04:29,444 --> 00:04:30,714
Missing meds.

114
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,054
Ooh. Did I get that right?

115
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,175
Uh, yeah.

116
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:36,998
But "missing meds" hardly
sounds like "firing Cheryl,"

117
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:38,113
so maybe you want to explain...

118
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:39,383
He thought Cheryl was stealing Diazepam.

119
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,953
That's why he wanted to fire her.

120
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,123
Any other questions?

121
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:42,991
Uh...

122
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,242
Boy, you really thought you
had him with that one, huh?

123
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:48,247
- Well, I...
- You got so excited for it.

124
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:50,383
Let me guess, you, ah,
practiced that notebook flip?

125
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,153
- Well, yes, obviously.
- I'd like to move on,

126
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:55,025
unless you have any other
big revelations in here.

127
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,165
Let's see. "From Gomez: Dear Morticia,

128
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,635
I feel so happy when I'm wit' ya."

129
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:01,073
I was just spit-balling
wedding vows there.

130
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,279
So you said you and Robert
were partners,

131
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:05,582
but it was Robert's name
on the business, correct?

132
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:08,256
Yeah. He started the practice
and then I joined after.

133
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:10,542
Uh, Captain, something's
come up in the case.

134
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:11,844
Can I talk to you outside for a sec?

135
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:14,626
What the hell are you doing in there?
You totally undermined me.

136
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:17,605
I know, and I apologize,
but I'm executing a strategy.

137
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,842
Oh, really, and what
strategy might that be?

138
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:21,178
Make Jake feel like an idiot,

139
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:22,871
or make Jake feel self-conscious

140
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:25,234
about his Addams Family-themed
wedding vows rap?

141
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,090
No, I want Philip to
underestimate you and fear me.

142
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,061
I'll badger him with
my superior intellect,

143
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,198
while simultaneously belittling you.

144
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,133
Once Philip dismisses you as a threat,

145
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,371
I'll leave you alone with him,
and he'll let his guard down.

146
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:38,409
If I didn't know any better,
I would say you're describing

147
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:39,865
smart cop/dumb cop.

148
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:42,014
Look, I thought you had him
on the calendar reveal.

149
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,351
But he was a step ahead.

150
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,287
You got flustered, and I realized

151
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:47,491
in the moment we could
use this to our advantage.

152
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:49,327
So what do you want me to do,
ask stupid questions?

153
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:51,364
Stupid questions, grammatical errors,

154
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,501
lose your train of thought,
just ask him to confess...

155
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,140
ooh, relate everything back
to those movies you've seen.

156
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:58,176
Kinda seems like a shot at me
about "Die Hard," but okay.

157
00:05:58,211 --> 00:06:00,313
This is not a comment on you, Peralta.

158
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:01,650
I just want to bring this guy down.

159
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,741
Yeah, that's all I want too.

160
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:08,161
And to possibly say,
"You can't handle the tooth."

161
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:10,010
You know, if it comes up naturally.

162
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:11,033
- It won't.
- It might.

163
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,290
I actually think... it can't.

164
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,968
So what do you say?

165
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:18,391
Me want to.

166
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:20,281
- Dumb cop.
- I got that.

167
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:21,417
- Yeah.
- Well done.

168
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:23,421
- Mm-hmm.
- So, the night of the murder,

169
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:25,090
you met with Robert
in the surgical suite.

170
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,426
Why there? Why not your office?

171
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:28,162
Uh, just preparing for
the next day's surgeries.

172
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:30,166
Don't you have an assistant
who does that?

173
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:33,138
I'm a meticulous person.
I'm careful how I do things.

174
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:34,602
So careful that you...

175
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:37,412
I'm sorry, I forgot what
I was gonna say.

176
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:38,683
Come back to me.

177
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:40,484
Now, we did a sweep of the room

178
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,720
where you and Robert fought.

179
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:43,154
- Talked.
- Right, talked.

180
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,542
- The entire room had been scrubbed.
- It had been cleaned.

181
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:47,738
It had undergone
industrial sterilization

182
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,469
to remove all traces of blood and DNA.

183
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:51,770
It's a surgical suite.

184
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:53,174
People bleed in there every day.

185
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:54,609
We have to sanitize it by law.

186
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:56,476
Ooh, I remembered what I was gonna ask.

187
00:06:57,444 --> 00:06:58,686
- Did you kill him?
- No.

188
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:00,619
Ah! If you had said yes,
I woulda had you!

189
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,291
So, after you and Robert fought...

190
00:07:03,326 --> 00:07:04,359
- Talked.
- You left the office,

191
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:05,490
but you didn't take your car?

192
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,994
I went to a bar, The Scotchman.

193
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,932
I didn't want to drive drunk,
so I took a cab.

194
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:09,912
And you didn't have your phone?

195
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:11,382
I left it charging in my office

196
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:13,509
and I didn't realize till I was
already out of the building.

197
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:15,813
Oh, man, if I go ten minutes
without looking at my phone,

198
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:17,816
my pumpkin crop dies on my little farm.

199
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:19,387
This is not the time

200
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:21,556
for stories about your
digital squash, Peralta.

201
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,260
- Fine.
- Talking about your phone.

202
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:25,130
Why does it matter that I forgot it?

203
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,837
Ohhh, if I had it on me,

204
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:30,878
you could've seen it
pinging off the cell tower.

205
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:32,477
Doesn't matter. Didn't have it on me.

206
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,647
So you took a cab to this bar.

207
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:36,650
Well, we talked to the
employees of the Scotchman.

208
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:39,106
- Nobody saw you there.
- Nobody remembers seeing me.

209
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,175
But let me ask you this...
did you kill him?

210
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,680
Nah. You know, it's not surprising

211
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:44,118
nobody remembers seeing me.

212
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:46,088
The bar was extremely
crowded that night,

213
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:47,524
and I spent my whole time in the corner

214
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,204
talking to this woman, Dana.

215
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,204
Oh, so you said.

216
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,909
But when we ran all
the credit card receipts,

217
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:54,613
nobody named Dana bought
any drinks that night.

218
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,854
Trust me, Dana wasn't
buying her own drinks.

219
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,724
- No?
- No.

220
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,992
Okay.

221
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:02,621
- Hold on.
- Hm?

222
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:04,599
I need to deal with this.
Let's take a five.

223
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:07,570
Or... I could keep this
interview going solo.

224
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:09,808
Of course. I'm sure that'll be, um...

225
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:11,030
pretty helpful.

226
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:14,769
All right. Where should we
start-a-rooski?

227
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:16,401
Don't you think maybe
we should just wait

228
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:17,671
till your boss comes back?

229
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:18,973
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

230
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:21,161
Because you're scared.

231
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:22,498
You know I'm playing hardball,

232
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,368
except for that the balls are questions.

233
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,537
And here they come.

234
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,239
What kind of car did Robert drive?

235
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,508
Also, Dana from the bar,
what color was her hair,

236
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,861
and which night does the cleaning crew
sterilize your office,

237
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:32,326
and have you ever been up
to where the body was found,

238
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:33,638
and when you left your phone
at the office,

239
00:08:33,674 --> 00:08:35,209
was it plugged into your
computer or an outlet,

240
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,195
and did you kill him, and what
did your cab driver look like?

241
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:39,774
This seems like a huge waste of time.

242
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,477
But, here you go.

243
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,502
Robert drove a Saab,
Dana's hair was blonde,

244
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,305
they sterilize on Wednesdays
and Saturdays,

245
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,974
I haven't been to Vernon in 20 years,

246
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,723
the phone was plugged into the wall,

247
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,026
no, I didn't kill him,

248
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,608
and the cab driver had a beard
and an earring...

249
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:53,380
I sorry I didn't get his license number.

250
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:55,292
Wow.

251
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,826
- Very impressive.
- Yeah.

252
00:08:57,861 --> 00:08:59,830
You didn't fall for my
"did you kill him" gambit.

253
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:00,631
No.

254
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:02,395
Although it is interesting that you knew

255
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:03,887
the body was found in Vernon, New York,

256
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:06,132
when that information hasn't
been released to the public.

257
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:13,106
Well, hello, Dolly.

258
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:15,568
_

259
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:17,980
I can't believe you thought
I was the dumb cop.

260
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,517
I mean, I've watched "Planet Earth."

261
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:21,225
With the British narrator.

262
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,223
I can tell you anything
you want to know about

263
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:25,427
"three-toed slow-ths"

264
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:27,129
and I got you to say you knew
where the body was found,

265
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:28,733
which kinda seems like something

266
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:29,868
only the murderer would've known.

267
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,472
Actually... Robert's wife told me.

268
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:35,677
I've been talking
with her a lot, comforting her.

269
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:36,946
We asked her not to share that info,

270
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:38,649
and she promised us she didn't.

271
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:40,619
Well, she's been distraught.
She might not remember.

272
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:43,024
Uh-huh. Flimsy. So what
did you mean when you said

273
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:45,061
that you hadn't been
to Vernon in 20 years?

274
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:47,666
My uncle has a cabin there.
I would visit him as a kid.

275
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,635
Wow. So your uncle owns a cabin

276
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,472
in the town that the body was found.

277
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,774
That is quite a coincidence.

278
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54,329
I haven't been there for 20 years.

279
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:55,800
You can call my uncle if you want.

280
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:57,850
Oh, we are. So you might
as well just confess now,

281
00:09:57,885 --> 00:10:00,114
or we can take our sweet time like...

282
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:02,684
the mer-jestic slow-th.

283
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,974
Either way, we've got you.

284
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,234
- We don't have him.
- But I just told him we did have him.

285
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:09,003
Philip's uncle said he hasn't
been to the cabin in months

286
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,513
and he hasn't spoken to Philip
in over a year.

287
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:11,840
Well, what about the neighbors?

288
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,211
There's only one other house
off that road

289
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,714
and we haven't been able
to contact the owner.

290
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,860
Yeah, but Philip doesn't know that.
He's rattled right now.

291
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:18,934
We tell him the neighbor saw him
that night, he'll crack for sure.

292
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,625
- So you want us to lie?
- No, I want me to lie

293
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,661
and for you to stand behind me

294
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:23,897
and say, like, three

295
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:25,698
<i>oh damn</i> 's when I really get cooking.

296
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,034
All right, fine, two oh-damns.

297
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:29,172
- One oh-damn?
- There will be no oh-damns.

298
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:31,142
But it will be so satisfying
in your deep, powerful voice.

299
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:32,845
- We're not lying.
- It's legal.

300
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,248
The Supreme Court said that
we're allowed to lie

301
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:35,361
in an interrogation.

302
00:10:35,397 --> 00:10:37,018
I told a perp that I knew
Steph Curry a couple days ago.

303
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,344
It had nothing to do with the case,

304
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,950
- but I could say it.
- It's a tactical mistake.

305
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:41,293
You're guessing what
happened that night.

306
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:42,930
But what if Philip never
went to the cabin?

307
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:45,100
He did. I can feel it here.

308
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:46,802
- Your stomach?
- No, my gut.

309
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:48,272
Your gut, or intestines, is lower.

310
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:49,908
You should point down here,
closer to your pubis.

311
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:51,744
- I'm good.
- Suppose you're wrong.

312
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,281
Now Philip knows we have nothing.

313
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:55,284
There goes our credibility
and our leverage.

314
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:57,661
No, we need a different strategy,

315
00:10:57,697 --> 00:10:59,733
All right, fine. How about this...

316
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:01,797
I convince him I'm unstable.

317
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:03,099
I run in there screaming,

318
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:04,902
I throw a chair through
the two-sided mirror,

319
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:06,705
glass goes everywhere. He's like,

320
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,774
"If Mad Dog Peralta will do that,

321
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,345
who knows what else he's capable of?"

322
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,115
No offense, but you don't
get angry well.

323
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,217
What? That's not true.
Remember how angry I got

324
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:15,787
about how fast Daenerys
got from Dragonstone

325
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:16,788
to north of the Wall?

326
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:17,791
That was intense.

327
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:19,827
You have a boyish face
and a big goofy grin.

328
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:21,978
It's like being yelled at
by a children's cereal mascot.

329
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,013
Hey, some of those are scary.
Count Chocula much?

330
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:27,209
All right, fine, I see your point.
What do you suggest?

331
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:28,817
Let's get all up in his personal space.

332
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,600
- Make him feel uncomfortable.
- Okay, fine.

333
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:32,951
Let's get intimate.

334
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:34,253
_

335
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:37,359
So, Philip, you're
hanging out at the bar

336
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:39,062
with "Dana."

337
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,196
How late did you stay?

338
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:41,737
I got in the cab around 3:30.

339
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:43,107
Kinda hard to find
a cab in that neighborhood.

340
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:44,491
Why not a ride-sharing service?

341
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:45,760
Didn't have my phone, remember?

342
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:47,142
- Did you talk to the driver?
- No.

343
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:48,245
What route did you take?

344
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:49,848
I don't know, I was watching Taxi TV.

345
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:51,383
- What was on?
- Fallon highlights.

346
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,254
- What was he doing?
- Slow-jamming the news.

347
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:55,090
- Who was the guest?
- Amy Adams.

348
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,229
- Who's that?
- Famous actress.

349
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:00,032
- Why would you...
- Wow.

350
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,969
You got some old silver
fillings in there.

351
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:04,261
You probably want to drill those out,
replace 'em with porcelain.

352
00:12:04,297 --> 00:12:07,455
- Okay, but why...
- And that is some serious plaque buildup.

353
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:08,848
- Let's get back to...
- No, no, no.

354
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:10,254
Open wider. Let me see.

355
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:13,444
Good God, when is the last time
you had a cleaning?

356
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,481
Damn it!

357
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:17,119
Not only did we not break him,
but now I have to go to the dentist?!

358
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:19,166
We need a new strategy.

359
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:21,036
And all this dental talk

360
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,471
has given me an idea.

361
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:24,000
- <i>Okay.</i>
- _

362
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,836
We have a few more questions
for you, doctor.

363
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:27,661
Doctor. Huh.

364
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:30,451
It's funny when people
call dentists "doctor."

365
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:31,513
We are doctors.

366
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:32,916
We do four years of medical school.

367
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,086
Yeah, but it's called "dental school."

368
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:35,555
But we learn about the entire body.

369
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:37,494
But if you had cancer,
you wouldn't call a dentist.

370
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,098
You know it's actually harder
to get into dental school

371
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,100
than medical school.

372
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,972
Well, because there
are fewer dental schools.

373
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:45,010
Because most people want
to become actual doctors.

374
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,480
That's ridiculous. It's not
like we're college professors

375
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,683
calling ourselves "doctors."

376
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,388
- Not the same thing, my friend.
- Well, sure it is.

377
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:52,124
When someone has a heart attack
on a plane,

378
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,260
do they yell out, "Yo, does anybody
here have an Art History PhD?"

379
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:56,898
A PhD is a doctorate.

380
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,135
It's literally describing a doctor.

381
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,504
- Maybe let's refocus.
- No!

382
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,008
The problem here is that
medical practitioners

383
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:04,178
have co-opted the word "doctor."

384
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:05,380
- Okay, Captain...
- I know we live in a world

385
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:07,451
where anything can mean anything,

386
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,865
and nobody even cares about etymolo...

387
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,528
Apparently that's a trigger for me.

388
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:15,146
Yeah, apparently.

389
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:17,925
So... now can we lie?

390
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:20,138
No, no. But you know what often works?

391
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,108
Making him confront his victim.

392
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:23,875
_

393
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,679
Look your dead friend in the eyes

394
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:27,380
and say his name.

395
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,591
Robert.

396
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:31,417
Okay, maybe say his full name.

397
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:33,420
- Robert Tupper.
- His middle name's Henry.

398
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:34,607
Robert Henry Tupper.

399
00:13:34,643 --> 00:13:36,146
His wife called him Rob. Work that in.

400
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,715
- Rob Tupper.
- Work it into the full name.

401
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:38,918
Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.

402
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:40,374
Now say it with a frown on your face.

403
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,594
Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.

404
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,664
Now try not to blink,
so tears come to your eyes.

405
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,834
Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.

406
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,104
Man, this guy is a good murderer!

407
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,957
There's got to be some way to break him.

408
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,099
Wait a minute. I just had an idea.

409
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:51,235
Two, three, four.

410
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,927
Yeah, I really got to stop
trying that. It never works.

411
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,166
_

412
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:03,909
Tell us more about your
relationship with Robert.

413
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:05,438
We've been over this a thousand times.

414
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:06,582
We got along well.

415
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:08,453
So you never fought, at all.
About anything.

416
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:10,821
I mean, we worked together.
We disagreed sometimes.

417
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:12,367
But we had a good partnership.

418
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:14,354
He never, for instance, skipped a party

419
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:17,259
so he could micromanage me
as I tried to do my job.

420
00:14:17,294 --> 00:14:18,561
That's what's happening here, right?

421
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:20,297
That's why you're wearing the tuxedo?

422
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:21,901
I skipped the opera,
not a party; it's no big deal.

423
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:23,369
Yeah, it's the Bugs Bunny one.

424
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,906
And I'm not here to micromanage anyone.

425
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:26,910
I'm here because I enjoy
interrogating scum.

426
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:28,344
- Scum like you.
- That was implied.

427
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:29,506
I just thought we had
a good rhythm going.

428
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:30,510
- We do.
- I know.

429
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:31,550
- Okay.
- Okay.

430
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,122
You don't think the fact
that he skipped the opera

431
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:35,138
has anything to do with
him not believing in you?

432
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,828
He believes in me.

433
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:39,364
Okay. Why did he make you dumb cop?

434
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,835
He didn't make me dumb cop,

435
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,237
not that it's any of your business.

436
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:44,340
We agreed on it as a strategy.

437
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,978
Right, but why wasn't he dumb cop?

438
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:48,546
Please. You never would
have bought that.

439
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,250
- What?
- It's just that, um,

440
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:53,288
between the two of us,
you are more believable as a...

441
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:54,624
- Dumb cop?
- Yes, dumb.

442
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:57,195
Uh, the-the dumber of two smart options.

443
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,361
Wow. Rough.

444
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,367
All right, that's enough.
You're not interrogating us.

445
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:02,037
- We're interrogating you.
- Exactly.

446
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:03,306
Tell us about that Diazepam.

447
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:04,575
If Cheryl didn't take it, then who did?

448
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,311
Because we're pretty sure it was you.

449
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:08,383
Honestly, it could have been
any one of our employees.

450
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:10,353
They all have access
to the storage room.

451
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,456
You know, it's silly, but, uh...

452
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,593
I trust the people who work for me.

453
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:16,229
I'm telling you,
Captain Holt is only in here

454
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:17,364
because I want him here.

455
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,134
Really? So you're in charge?

456
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,206
And all those strategies you've
been coming after me with,

457
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:23,341
those were all your ideas?

458
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:25,312
Right. The guitar thing was mine.

459
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:27,115
And you signed off on that?

460
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,317
- Well...
- Seriously?

461
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:30,421
- Ooh, this is sad.
- Shut up.

462
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:32,224
- I just feel bad for you.
- I said shut up.

463
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:34,628
Your boss thinks you're
an idiot; that can't feel good.

464
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:36,298
All right, listen, you son of a bitch,

465
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,466
you think you're smarter than us?

466
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:38,670
You think you've gotten away with it?

467
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,439
You haven't. We're gonna find something.

468
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,341
One skin cell, one eyelash,

469
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,211
one tiny inconsistency in your story,

470
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:46,349
and you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in prison.

471
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:48,320
Everyone who loves you will leave,

472
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:49,488
and you will die alone!

473
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:51,524
And at that time, it will be your head

474
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,079
that a bear has sex with!

475
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,739
I'm pretty sure you're going for angry,

476
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:01,442
but in my mind, it just seems like

477
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:04,114
when a Muppet gets upset
and starts going like...

478
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:05,649
Oh, you want angry?

479
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:07,354
I'll show you angry!

480
00:16:10,394 --> 00:16:11,594
Do you feel like I lost the upper hand?

481
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:13,129
Because I still think it's about 50/50.

482
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:14,565
I told you getting angry wouldn't work.

483
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,269
Well, your brilliant ideas
haven't gotten us anywhere either.

484
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:18,572
I'm telling you, the only thing
that's gonna work

485
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:20,008
is lying about the cabin.

486
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:21,610
That would be a huge mistake.

487
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:23,547
- It'll work.
- No, it will backfire

488
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,118
and jeopardize the entire case.

489
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:26,753
Oh, so Philip is right,
you don't trust me at all.

490
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:29,291
Stop it! You know you're
one of my best detectives.

491
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:30,560
So let me do this my way.

492
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:33,007
I did. I let you do it your way,

493
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:34,377
and it was a disaster.

494
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:35,802
I had to jump in with
the dumb cop gambit

495
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:37,339
to rescue the interrogation.

496
00:16:37,374 --> 00:16:38,236
I'm sorry.

497
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:39,340
I know you're frustrated, Peralta.

498
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:41,051
But the fact is, we don't have enough.

499
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,314
We may not get a confession.

500
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:43,349
It happens.

501
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,859
You're right.

502
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:48,346
I'm sorry.

503
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:51,242
This guy has just really
gotten under my skin.

504
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,146
- Mine too.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom

505
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:54,413
and try and clear my head.

506
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:55,954
- I think that's a good idea.
- Good.

507
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,448
Oh, no, Peralta, what are you doing?

508
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,118
Guess what, you dick?

509
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:05,089
I just got off the phone with Vernon PD.

510
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,624
Oh, no, no, no.

511
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:07,693
Your uncle's neighbors
saw you go into the cabin

512
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:08,881
the night of the murder.

513
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:11,566
They ID'd your photo.
I've got you dead to rights.

514
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:13,168
Interesting.

515
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:15,639
But, uh, my uncle only has one neighbor,

516
00:17:15,674 --> 00:17:17,643
and I'm pretty sure
he didn't identify me.

517
00:17:17,678 --> 00:17:19,680
Oh, really? Because you were so careful?

518
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:21,900
Because he's been dead three years.

519
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:24,817
Well.

520
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,294
I'm friends with Steph Curry.

521
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,399
So...

522
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:32,457
_

523
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:34,473
So, this is how it looks to me.

524
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:36,426
You were lying in an attempt
to frame my client.

525
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:38,236
No, no, no, no. Look
Even if we were lying

526
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:39,706
- about having a witness...
- Which you are.

527
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,706
- The neighbor's dead.
- No, it could've been a squatter

528
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:44,505
or a hunter or a squatting hunter,
not all hunters have homes...

529
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,555
Peralta's point is, legally,
he can say whatever the hell he wants

530
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:48,086
- in an interrogation.
- True.

531
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:50,447
But that doesn't
play so well with juries.

532
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,719
You screwed up, and my client's leaving.

533
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,988
No! He can't leave until I dismiss him.

534
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:56,659
You've had him for ten hours

535
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:58,369
and 45 minutes.

536
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:00,207
15 more and we file a harassment claim.

537
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:02,513
Great! Then I'll just
keep him for 14 minutes.

538
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,763
Seriously? Just to be childish?

539
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,933
Yuh doy!

540
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:07,804
I told you not to lie!

541
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:09,182
What were you thinking?!

542
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:10,586
I thought it would work.

543
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,356
And I wanted to be the one that got him.

544
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,594
Is this about your ego?

545
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:15,976
Are you that desperate for everyone
to know how great you are?

546
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,307
It's not about everyone.

547
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:18,653
Okay? It's just...

548
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,032
I wanted you to know.

549
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,983
Oh, my God.

550
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:30,973
I got it!

551
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,080
He's not answering any questions.

552
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:35,482
That's okay. I have no questions.

553
00:18:35,518 --> 00:18:37,483
That's right.
I'm about to monologue, son.

554
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,434
You better make it quick.
You only got eight minutes.

555
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,022
All right, then let me
paint you a picture...

556
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:42,694
of Philip, a successful periodontist

557
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,165
that's become addicted to Diazepam,

558
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:45,916
a sedative I take because
I'm junkie scum.

559
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:47,588
Also, for real, addiction is a disease.

560
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:49,281
I would be super empathetic
if you hadn't murdered a man.

561
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:50,788
- What is the point of this?
- I'll get there.

562
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:53,321
So, one day I'm working late when
my boss Robert surprises me.

563
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:54,695
He found out I was stealing meds...

564
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,478
again, junkie scum...
also again, not your fault.

565
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:58,054
There's a major genetic
component to addiction.

566
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,591
He says he's gonna file a police report.

567
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:00,927
I could lose my license.

568
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:02,696
We fight, and something
in me just snaps,

569
00:19:02,732 --> 00:19:05,136
so I grab the first thing I can
find, and I hit him with it.

570
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:06,505
You still have no murder weapon.

571
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,850
I do now. Here's a pic I found on Yelp

572
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:10,385
of the surgical suite six months ago,

573
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:12,423
and here is a shot that our
crime scene photographer

574
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:14,260
took of the same room two weeks
after the murder.

575
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:15,830
- Notice any differences?
- We're not answering that.

576
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:17,463
That's all right, I can just
tell you myself.

577
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:19,647
The Yelp shot has six of these
heavy-looking glass awards

578
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:21,686
from the Brooklyn Periodontics Society

579
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:24,359
in the background, whereas
this shot only has five.

580
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:25,594
What happened to number six?

581
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:27,442
- Murdered Robert with it!
- I didn't.

582
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:29,414
You lost all control and you
bludgeoned him to death.

583
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,886
There must have been blood
everywhere, but you got lucky.

584
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,082
You were in the surgical
suite; it can be sterilized.

585
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:36,178
You never would have gotten away
with it in your carpeted office.

586
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:37,943
- That's not what happened.
- Don't say anything more, Philip.

587
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:40,331
And your office manager would
have heard all of the screaming

588
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,023
but she was at her grandson's play.

589
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,330
- Lucky again.
- You're wrong.

590
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:44,865
You put Robert's body into a wheelchair

591
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:46,118
and shoved it in the elevator.

592
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:47,687
It's a miracle there
wasn't blood everywhere.

593
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:49,786
- That's not true.
- Now you're in the garage with a corpse.

594
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,935
You panicked and left
your phone in your office,

595
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:53,050
and you don't have your car keys,

596
00:19:53,086 --> 00:19:55,676
but Robert's are in his pocket
so you put him in his car

597
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:56,908
- and you take off.
- No.

598
00:19:56,944 --> 00:19:58,164
- You can't believe what you've done.
- No.

599
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,269
- Philip.
- You're flustered.

600
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:00,869
You have no GPS,
so you just start driving.

601
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:01,999
- No!
- Philip!

602
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,135
Next thing you know,
you're in the Pine Barrens,

603
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,503
and it hits you: your uncle's cabin.

604
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,539
He has a place there.

605
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:06,723
You're the luckiest son of a bitch...

606
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,664
- It wasn't luck!
- Yes, it was.

607
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,034
- You got lucky at every turn!
- No.

608
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:10,792
I knew exactly where I was driving,

609
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:12,796
I left my phone in
the office on purpose,

610
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:14,334
I was in the surgical suite by design,

611
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,836
and I didn't use some glass award

612
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:17,842
that any idiot would
clearly see was missing.

613
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:20,012
I made a rod out
of a special dental polymer,

614
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:21,984
killed him with it,
then melted it back down.

615
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,612
It's already in a patient's
mouth... son!

616
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:30,831
Oh, damn.

617
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:32,270
Oh, damn.

618
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:34,241
Oh, damn!

619
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,512
And that is three oh-damns.

620
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:38,040
Oh, damn!

621
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:43,172
Ohhh. Fresh air.

622
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,588
Wow, I don't say that a lot.

623
00:20:45,624 --> 00:20:48,360
There's one thing I still
don't understand.

624
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,423
Did you know you had
the wrong murder weapon?

625
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,424
Ah, excellent question, sir.

626
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,527
Yes. I spotted the missing dental award

627
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:56,663
when I first took the case.

628
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:57,701
I asked around weeks ago.

629
00:20:57,737 --> 00:20:59,769
Turns out a cleaning lady
knocked it over and shattered it.

630
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,066
Then why did you run in there like that?

631
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:02,402
Because in talking to you,

632
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:04,595
I realized what Philip's
worst fear actually was:

633
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,884
that we would think he was just
some dummy that got lucky.

634
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:08,027
Right.

635
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,971
He had planned the perfect crime.

636
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:12,344
And it killed him when you said
he was sloppy and impulsive.

637
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,013
He needed us to know how smart he was.

638
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:16,586
Right. Like someone else I know.

639
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,897
Yup.

640
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,447
Kevin.

641
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:26,557
I'm proud of you, Peralta.

642
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,547
Thank you, sir.

643
00:21:29,502 --> 00:21:31,353
Now let's go get some sleep.

644
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,690
Hey, guys.

645
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,127
My goodness. We're almost late for work.

646
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:38,031
Oh. Well, in that case,

647
00:21:38,228 --> 00:21:39,462
good morning, sir.

648
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,566
Good morning, Peralta.

649
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,662
God, I love this job.

650
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:50,467

1
00:00:01,152 --> 00:00:03,187
So, do you recognize any of these men?

2
00:00:03,222 --> 00:00:04,751
I was hiding in the bathroom stall,

3
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:05,863
so I didn't see his face.

4
00:00:05,898 --> 00:00:07,318
But I heard him.

5
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:09,220
He was singing along
to the music at the bar.

6
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:10,366
Do you remember what he was singing?

7
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:12,599
I think it was that song,
"I Want It That Way."

8
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:14,911
Backstreet Boys. I'm familiar. Okay.

9
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:17,194
Number one, could you
please sing the opening

10
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:18,362
to "I Want It That Way"?

11
00:00:18,397 --> 00:00:19,373
Really?

12
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:21,307
Okay.

Ah, chills! Literal chills.

29
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:07,036
It was number five.
Number five killed my brother.

30
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:08,537
Oh, my God, I forgot about that part.

32
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,193
Hey, it's time. You ready? You excited?

33
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:34,130
Yes, I can't believe it's
finally gonna happen.

34
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:36,889
Aw, you guys are gonna have
sex for the first time.

35
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:40,310
I'll have you know Amy
and I do sex 24-sevs, 369.

36
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:41,946
Oh no, I grossly overcompensated

37
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,080
and now it seems like we have problems.

38
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,322
- You done?
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:46,384
Great. Jake's sister is
flying in from Dallas,

40
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:47,685
and we're picking her up at the airport.

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,186
- You have a sister?
- Half-sister.

42
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:50,988
Turns out that my slutty pilot dad

43
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:53,190
made daughters is several
major airline hubs.

44
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:57,528
ATL and EWR didn't respond when
I reached out, but DFW is DTM.

45
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:59,463
Down to meet. Well, we should get going.

46
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:02,110
Her flight's gonna land soon,
but wish me luck.

47
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:03,480
I'm about to be a brother.

48
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,037
Captain Holt, I need a...

49
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:07,438
what's going on?

50
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:09,306
My doctor said I should be more active,

51
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:12,109
but my squash club recently
transitioned to racquetball.

52
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:13,544
Since I'm not a dope-smoking hooligan,

53
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:14,945
I decided to quit.

54
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:16,246
Boyle is teaching me yoga.

55
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,582
Genevieve got me into it.

56
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:18,682
You can't believe
how many different ways

57
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:21,218
I can wrap my legs around her. Six!

58
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:22,686
Captain, if you wanted to be healthier,

59
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,837
why not come to me? I'm ripped as hell.

60
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:27,925
Sarge, health is about
flexibility and peace of mind

61
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,829
and bone strength, not
building vanity muscles.

62
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:33,207
Vanity muscles? I use all of these.

63
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:34,842
Really? Even the large neck ones?

64
00:02:34,877 --> 00:02:36,779
They help me sleep upright on airplanes!

65
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:38,388
Well, there's no reason to be defensive,

66
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:40,544
just because you don't have
the bone strength of a yogi.

67
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,840
We all have our thing. You're a muscler,

68
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,923
I'm a boner.

69
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:46,410
Terry can do yoga.

70
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:48,045
Terry is a yoga beast.

71
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:49,947
Watch. Give me a yoga to do.

72
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:51,982
Ah, well, we're in warrior pose now,

73
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:54,285
but I suppose for you we can
start in child's pose.

74
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,908
Terry is not a child!

75
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,622
Terry is a warrior.

76
00:02:58,657 --> 00:02:59,929
And...

77
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:04,228
That didn't sound good.
Are you okay, Jeffords?

78
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,715
I'm fine.

79
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,501
Now, if you'll excuse me,

80
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:10,967
I'm going to walk out of here normally

81
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:13,604
using my trademark tiny steps.

82
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,672
Okay?

83
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:18,476
What you looking at?

84
00:03:18,511 --> 00:03:21,145
Did the Kanye West cannibalism
story finally break?

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,480
- What? Is that a thing?
- Yeah.

86
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:24,181
He eats tiny little bites of people

87
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:26,016
when he hugs them goodbye.

88
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:28,319
I tipped off Page Six, I don't
know why they're sitting on it.

89
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:29,651
Just looking on a dating app.

90
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:31,689
Weird. Lame. Gross.

91
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:33,529
Dumb. Freak. Loser.

92
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:35,111
Perv. Toothy. Mouthy.

93
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:36,694
- Well, what happened to Becky?
- Who?

94
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:38,647
The girl you were seeing
whose name you wouldn't tell us

95
00:03:38,682 --> 00:03:40,238
so we just started calling her Becky.

96
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:42,023
Becky and I broke up.
She ate soup too much.

97
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:43,566
- What, like every day?
- It happened twice.

98
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,309
Okay, well, listen, you're in luck.

99
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:47,678
Because I have the perfect girl for you,

100
00:03:47,713 --> 00:03:49,213
and I'm actually texting
with her right now.

101
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:51,130
No. You are terrible at setting me up.

102
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,408
Remember that dork, Justin?

103
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:53,743
He was a tattoo artist,

104
00:03:53,778 --> 00:03:56,046
- and he rode a motorcycle.
- A Yamaha.

105
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,814
He might as well have picked me
up in a station wagon.

106
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,750
You know what, men are
difficult because they're all

107
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:02,419
secretly monsters, but now
that I know you're bi,

108
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:04,858
that changes everything.
I know so many great women.

109
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:07,098
I'm sorry. I just don't think
this is something you're good at.

110
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,927
What? The only thing
I'm not good at is modesty,

111
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,795
because I'm great at it.

112
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:14,698
Okay, according to the flight board,

113
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,066
she should be here any minute.

114
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:18,769
I love watching a "TBD"
turn into a gate num.

115
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:20,370
What's wrong?

116
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:21,972
- Why do you look like that?
- I'm so nervous.

117
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:23,836
My hands are shaking and
my butt is hella sweaty.

118
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:25,157
I totally understand.

119
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:27,778
I freaked out when I met my
pen pal from Thailand, Mongkut.

120
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:29,012
But everything worked out, right?

121
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:30,367
You and Mongkut are
lifelong friends now.

122
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,649
No, Mongkut turned out to
be a 45-year-old prisoner.

123
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:33,784
It was a really awkward trip.

124
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:36,820
That sounds horrible. Amy,
what if this is a Mongkut situation?

125
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:38,413
Oh no, that pen pal service
is shut down.

126
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:40,724
This is your sister.
It's gonna be great.

127
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,051
You just have to relax and be yourself.

128
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:44,820
But what if myself isn't
good enough, you know?

129
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:46,421
What if I'm the Mongkut?

130
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:47,923
- Jake...
- Right. You're right.

131
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,658
It's gonna be great.
Just got to stay positive.

132
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:51,335
We're gonna see each other
from across the room,

133
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,136
we'll lock eyes, I'll say "noice,"

134
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,505
she'll say "toit,"
and then six months later,

135
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,540
we'll be on "The Amazing Race" together.

136
00:04:56,575 --> 00:04:57,541
Jake?

137
00:04:57,576 --> 00:04:59,776
Ka... oh, no.

138
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,645
It's me, Kate. Give me a hug.

139
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,041
- Stand down, ma'am.
- Back off, dude!

140
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:05,815
- That's my brother!
- Oh, no.

141
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,983
It's a Mongkut situation.

142
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:13,187
So, this is awkward,

143
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:14,355
but we should probably address

144
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,357
- the elephant in the room.
- Right.

145
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:18,459
Are we doing table apps or solo apps?

146
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:20,227
Uh, table apps and lots of them.

147
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:22,263
If it is fried, it must be tried.

148
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:24,265
- Johnny Cochran.
- I remember when he said that.

149
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,766
- Jake.
- Right.

150
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:28,636
So, what I actually meant was,

151
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:30,404
we should probably talk about the whole

152
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,406
handcuffs at the airport thing.

153
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:33,840
I know. I'm so sorry.

154
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:35,309
That was a really bad first impression.

155
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:36,777
It's just, I was on the plane

156
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:38,212
and started to get really nervous

157
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:39,747
about meeting you for the first time.

158
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:41,087
I was nervous to meet you too.

159
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:42,384
My butt got hella sweaty.

160
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,025
- I told Amy. You can ask her.
- Please don't.

161
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,978
So I went to the bathroom and
started vaping to calm down.

162
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,290
Then this weird-ass lady comes
up to me, and I'm like,

163
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:51,260
bitch, you're trying to tell me
your kid doesn't like the smell

164
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:52,967
of cotton candy?

165
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:54,336
Right, but the only thing I don't get

166
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:56,105
is why they would
handcuff you for vaping.

167
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,474
Because they're the worst!

168
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:58,865
Yeah, Amy, 'cause they're the worst.

169
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,833
Also, I slapped a stewardess,

170
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:02,249
real hard.

171
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:04,539
With my fist.

172
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:05,597
Oh.

173
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,208
So they were not the worst.

174
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,576
Oh, my God, are you mad at me?

175
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:12,879
Oh, no, I messed this up.
I am so sorry, Jake.

176
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,548
I really wanted this trip to go well

177
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,217
and was looking forward to
finally having a brother

178
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:17,720
for the first time.

179
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:19,556
You know what, I'm just...
I think I'm just gonna leave.

180
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:21,158
No, don't leave, okay?

181
00:06:21,193 --> 00:06:22,694
It's fine. I get it.

182
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,564
It's so crazy that we're
finally meeting each other.

183
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:26,711
So just forget about the plane.
That's ancient history.

184
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:27,795
- Really?
- Yes.

185
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,229
This trip was about us
getting to know each other,

186
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,831
- so let's do that.
- Okay.

187
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:32,166
What's your favorite scene
in "Die Hard"?

188
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:33,469
Die what?

189
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:34,870
It's okay. It's okay.

190
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:37,133
Um, when was the last time
you saw your dad?

191
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:39,979
I mean, I've only ever
met him like nine times.

192
00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:42,652
Ten if you count the time
he sent his co-pilot Steve

193
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,311
to hang out with me, 'cause
he was too hungover.

194
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:46,313
I remember Steve.
He taught me how to shave.

195
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:47,957
- He taught me how to shave.
- Where?

196
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:50,517
- Steve was the best.
- Freakin' Steve.

197
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:56,423
Jeffords, what are you still doing here?

198
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,156
You're clearly injured. Go home.

199
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:00,992
I'm totally fine. Here. I can prove it.

200
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,338
I'm fine. See?

201
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:13,710
You can't have thought
that went well for you.

202
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:16,577
It's okay, Sarge. Just admit
you can't handle yoga.

203
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:17,977
I can handle it fine.

204
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:20,542
I'm just a little sore from my
real workouts.

205
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:22,979
With weights. Now, I've got work to do.

206
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,675
Oops.

207
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,576
Dropped my phone. You know what?

208
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:29,292
My contract is up.

209
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:31,161
It's time for an upgrade anyway.

210
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:36,797
- Scully?
- Huh?

211
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,231
Where's your secret nap room?

212
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:39,499
I don't know what you're talking about.

213
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,180
Help me! Please!

214
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:46,072
Couch. Space heater.

215
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:48,108
We soundproof for maximum privacy.

216
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:50,209
And there's sodas and candy
in the mini fridge.

217
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:53,013
- This room's a little small.
- We had a big nap room,

218
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:55,615
and you gave it to Gina to pump
breast milk in, remember?!

219
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,850
Sorry, Scully.

220
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:58,185
You tell anyone about this place,

221
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,987
I will burn your life to the ground.

222
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,522
Oh, and there's a spray if you fart.

223
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:05,992
<i>Okay, that is nothing.</i>

224
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,028
The one parent-teacher
conference my dad went to,

225
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,897
he had sex with my teacher
on top of the diorama I made

226
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:12,299
of the first Thanksgiving.

227
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:14,267
Oh, no, he ruined all your hard work.

228
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:16,036
Oh, not really, it was just
a bunch of Smurfs on a plate.

229
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:17,571
- Oh.
- He came to visit once,

230
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:20,140
and hooked up with my mom's
entire book club.

231
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:22,175
She can't see a copy of
"A Prayer For Owen Meany"

232
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,555
without fully weeping.

233
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:24,590
I don't know what that is.

234
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:25,992
But enough about our dad.

235
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:27,195
- What's going on in your life?
- Honestly,

236
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,197
it's been a tough year.

237
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,733
I lost my job,

238
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,936
love of my life Kurt
just broke up with me.

239
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:33,205
Oh, hey, Amy has seven brothers.

240
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:34,507
Maybe you could date one of them.

241
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:35,976
Oh, snap. I'm down to clown.

242
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:37,812
Which one has the best body?

243
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,826
- Uhhh...
- Tony.

244
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,695
Right? It's very clearly Tony.

245
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,963
I don't know why she hesitated.

246
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:45,031
- Tony got bod.
- Tony it is.

247
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,033
Anyway, that's my boring life in Dallas.

248
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,669
But I'm here now, and I want
to see the real New York.

249
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:50,904
Let's like...

250
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:52,305
Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge?

251
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,773
Get tanked at the Times
Square Olive Garden.

252
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:55,242
And get our pictures taken
with a human statue.

253
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:57,210
Right. The real New York.

254
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,880
- Whenever you're ready.
- Hey, let me get dinner.

255
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:01,114
I had like ten more drinks
than you guys.

256
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,782
- Oh, are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

257
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:05,318
Wow, that is so sweet,
and totally unneces...

258
00:09:05,353 --> 00:09:06,987
- what are you doing?
- Life hack.

259
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:08,855
Hey, there's glass in my food!

260
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,023
Oh, my God oh my God,
oh my God oh my God...

261
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:11,691
What kind of restaurant is this?!

262
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:14,561
Where's Holt? He told me
to come in here.

263
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,229
Nope. That was me.

264
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,565
I've been recording his voice
for the past two years,

265
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,333
and now I have a soundboard
where I can make him say

266
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:22,545
anything I want. Check it out.

267
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:28,240
<i>Diaz. I. Need. To. See. You.
In. The. Briefing. Room. Now.</i>

268
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,976
Pretty cool, right? Watch this.

269
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:31,845
<i>Milk. Milk. Lemonade.</i>

270
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,781
<i>Around. The. Corner. Fudge. Is. Made.</i>

271
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:36,216
- That is amazing.
- Isn't it?

272
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:37,651
- What do you want?
- To find you love.

273
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:38,952
- Ugh.
- Come on!

274
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:41,121
Check it out: Dannika, 34.

275
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:43,123
- The only female trader...
- Pass.

276
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:44,724
Finance people are the worst.

277
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,626
Okay, well, take a gander at Jessica,

278
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:48,695
professional stuntwoman

279
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,364
just back from a surf trip in Bali...

280
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,133
Pass. People who surf
never shut up about it.

281
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:55,302
Kinda true. You know who
doesn't surf? Gabrielle.

282
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:57,737
- I'm out.
- Come on, Rosa.

283
00:09:57,772 --> 00:09:59,806
Give me a shot. If I mess it up, fine.

284
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,341
I'll drop it, and I'll
never bring it up again.

285
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,643
Fine. One date. That's all you get.

286
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:06,279
- That's all I need.
<i>- Hey. Diaz.</i>

287
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,682
<i>Enjoy. Having. Sexual. Fun.</i>

288
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:11,017
<i>With. Linetti's. Lesbian. Friend.</i>

289
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:13,787
<i>Get. Some. Get. Some. Get. Some.</i>

290
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,723
So, your sister's a bit of a nightmare.

291
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:18,858
I wouldn't say that. I mean,
at most, she's a daymare.

292
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:20,694
- Those are so much scarier.
- Yeah.

293
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:22,157
She put glass in her food, Jake.

294
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:23,330
She's a con-woman.

295
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:24,640
Look, she's a survivor.

296
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:26,109
She's had a really hard life.

297
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:28,101
And I thought it bad 'cause I
would only see my dad

298
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:29,869
for like an afternoon once a year,

299
00:10:29,904 --> 00:10:32,906
but compared to her, I was
a real DJ Tanner. "Full House."

300
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:35,627
- Her dad was always around.
- Yeah, I've seen "Full House."

301
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:38,144
Look, I'm sorry she's
not what you expected.

302
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,679
She is a lot.

303
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:41,781
But she's my sister. And she's young,

304
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:43,416
and she just got out
of a really bad breakup...

305
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:45,118
Whoo!

306
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,571
She's home.

307
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:49,674
Kate! Are you okay?

308
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,191
Sounds like you're breaking stuff.

309
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:53,793
Hey! I'm sorry, were we being too loud?

310
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:56,062
- We?
- Oh, hey. I'm William.

311
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:57,631
I thought you just wanted a picture.

312
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,667
Oh, we took a lot
of pictures. Get in here!

313
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,869
- Oh, no, he's my brother.
- That doesn't bother me.

314
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:04,070
Okay, I'm going to bed.

315
00:11:04,105 --> 00:11:05,750
Okay.

316
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:07,490
Time to go home.

317
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:12,813
Oh, no. Terry can't move.

318
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,799
Terry needs help.

319
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:17,617
Hel...

320
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:23,823
Ugh, there are silver
butt prints everywhere.

321
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:26,393
Why did he need to paint
his butt? He wears pants.

322
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:28,028
Look, I'm sorry about all this.

323
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,229
I really thought she
was gonna be like me.

324
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:31,798
But scamming restaurants and
hooking up with street performers,

325
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,166
she is 100% my dad.

326
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:34,734
Look, it's a two-day trip.

327
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,770
We just need to survive
the next 18 hours.

328
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:38,772
- Sure, sure.
- And, you know, I sat through

329
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:40,407
a whole play once, so I can
get through anything.

330
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:42,175
I took you to that play,
and you said you loved it.

331
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,810
- Because I did.
- Well,

332
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:46,079
55 minutes in the shower
and that silver paint

333
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:48,415
- will not come off.
- Gross.

334
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,350
Anyway, my astrologer
is always telling me

335
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:51,818
everything happens for a reason,

336
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:53,720
and I'm like, then why did Kurt dump me?

337
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,021
But now I know why.

338
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:57,057
So I would leave Dallas
and move to New York

339
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,591
to be near you!

340
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:00,794
Whoa, really? I mean, that's great,

341
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:02,328
but, you know, it's so expensive here.

342
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:03,643
I'll be fine.

343
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,765
I got a head full of dreams,
and a pocket full of glass.

344
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,635
I'm a New Yorker now. Fuggedabout it!

345
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,303
Yes.

346
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:12,106
Forget about it.

347
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:17,522
Babe. What are we gonna do?

348
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:18,990
My sister cannot move here.

349
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:21,113
I'll just tell her it's a bad
idea, and she shouldn't do it.

350
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,848
Ugh, but I'm the only family she has.

351
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:24,184
I don't want to hurt her feelings

352
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,353
and send her into a downward spiral.

353
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:26,955
She slept with a tin man, Jake.

354
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:28,091
I don't think the spiral goes
any further down.

355
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:29,393
Right. Wait, I've got it.

356
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,658
The only reason Kate wants to move here
is because Kurt dumped her,

357
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,157
but what if we can get him
to take her back?

358
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:35,002
Then she would definitely
want to stay in Dallas!

359
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:38,007
Ooh, that's smart, but what
if he's a rational person

360
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:39,610
and he doesn't want to be
with her anymore?

361
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:41,345
Not a problem.
I found his Facebook page.

362
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,180
He just posted a black and
white photo of a dead flower

363
00:12:43,215 --> 00:12:44,348
with the hashtags "my heart,"
"Kate forever"

364
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:46,050
and "love is dead."

365
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:47,648
- He misses her for some reason.
- Amy, this is it.

366
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,181
He clearly already wants
to get back together.

367
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:51,122
All we have to do is convince
him to fly here.

368
00:12:51,157 --> 00:12:52,431
- Jake, this might work.
- Yes!

369
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:53,967
But are we actually gonna do this?

370
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:55,880
Are we really going to fly
a man to New York City

371
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,650
just to ensure that my new
sister doesn't move here?

372
00:12:57,686 --> 00:12:59,043
Hey, Amy, do you have
a morning-after pill

373
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,613
I could bomb? I will get you back.

374
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:03,586
Use. My. Miles.

375
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:05,613
Boyle, have you seen Sergeant Jeffords?

376
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:08,592
Oh, do you mean Sore-gent Jeff-hurts?

377
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:10,016
He didn't make it home
last night, Boyle.

378
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:12,211
- Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
- You should be.

379
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:13,606
He could be in grave danger,

380
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:15,042
and you just flippantly
called him Sore-gent.

381
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:17,480
Oh, my God. I'm the worst.
Who does that?

382
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:19,998
Well, his car's still here, so I don't
think he ever left the building.

383
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:21,523
- He's probably fine.
- What?

384
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,226
Then why did you make me feel so bad?

385
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,580
To teach you a lesson about

386
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:26,549
about the destructive power of wordplay.

387
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:28,534
Now, where could he be?

388
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:33,597
Why are we going home?

389
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:35,599
We haven't even done
the "Sex and the City" tour.

390
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:37,004
Oh, my gosh, I am such a

391
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,236
"that one who fell through
the sidewalk hole."

392
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:41,572
Yeah, you totally are.
We're just so excited

393
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:42,643
you're moving here, we thought,

394
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:45,217
why not go straight home
and celebrate at exactly 8:00?

395
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:46,719
- Kate.
- Kurt?

396
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:49,056
- Kurt? The Kurt?
- What?! Oh, my God,

397
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:50,525
what are the chances?

398
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:52,581
Kate, you didn't tell us
how handsome Kurt is.

399
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:53,883
I love your...

400
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:55,453
jean shorts.

401
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:57,488
Babe, breaking up with you

402
00:13:57,523 --> 00:13:59,369
was the biggest mistake of my life.

403
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,926
It was? Oh, my God, he flew all the way

404
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:04,562
to New York to tell me that.
That's so romantic.

405
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:05,946
It's beautiful, really.

406
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:07,282
You're not even allowed
to leave the state.

407
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:08,307
- What's that now?
- One more time?

408
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:10,137
You think I'm gonna let
my skank parole officer

409
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:11,539
stand in the way of true love?

410
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:12,641
Kurt!

411
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:15,585
He seems like a cool guy.

412
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:17,673
Jeffords isn't in the evidence locker.

413
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:18,783
He's not in the file room, either.

414
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:20,976
I mean, there's nowhere
left to hide. I'm worried.

415
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:24,247
Actually, I think I know where he is.

416
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,947
I could take you there, but
you need to wear blindfolds.

417
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:28,292
- No.
- Okay.

418
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:30,295
I guess he'll just die in
Supply Closet F, then.

419
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:31,631
He's in Supply Closet F!

420
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,727
Great work.

421
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:36,227
I'm sorry. I feel so stupid.

422
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:39,196
Oh, it's okay. They tricked you somehow.

423
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:41,209
I still love you, buddy.

424
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:46,504
- Oh, thank God, you found me!
- Jeffords, are you okay?

425
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:48,372
Charles was right.
I couldn't handle yoga.

426
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:49,557
Well, we're here to help.

427
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:51,374
I'll get a couple officers
to help lift you up.

428
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,609
No need. I can handle this.

429
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,111
Charles, there's no way you can lift me.

430
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:57,248
Yoga's given me great
bone strength, Terry.

431
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:59,036
So get ready...

432
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,596
you're about to enter the bone zone.

433
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:03,232
- Not a thing.
- Shhh.

434

Rosa, I want to introduce you
to my friend Trishelle.

439
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,373
- Hi.
- Sparks.

440
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:24,408
Well, I'm gonna take off.
You two have fun.

441
00:15:24,443 --> 00:15:25,936
<i>Get. Some.</i>

442
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:27,889
I made a mobile version.

443
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:29,559
So, what are you drinking?

444
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,730
I'll have a margarita.

445
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:32,349
But, like, a skinny margarita.

446
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:36,153
So, like, tequila, lime,
and a tiny splash of agave.

447
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:38,455
- Mm. I refuse to order that.
- You don't have to.

448
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,391
I heard her. What do you want?

449
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:42,716
Just take your cheapest whisky
and pour it into your nearest glass.

450
00:15:42,752 --> 00:15:44,929
- That's a drink.
- So, with this diet

451
00:15:44,964 --> 00:15:48,198
that I'm on, you can eat
anything that's clear.

452
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:50,301
- Mm.
- Like rice noodles,

453
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:51,835
pineapple gummi bears...

454
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,571
So Kurt and I talked,

455
00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:57,007
and I'm sorry, Jake, I know
I said I'd stay in New York,

456
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,009
but I can't give up on this guy.

457
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:00,878
Especially not after he
flew out here for me.

458
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:03,744
Well, sounds like the universe just
really wants you to be in Dallas.

459
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,960
But on a personal note,
it is such a bummer.

460
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,263
I just missed her so much.

461
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:08,919
And so do the kids.

462
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:10,020
Oh, you have kids?

463
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:11,244
Kurt has six.

464
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,223
Who's watching them now?

465
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:14,572
- The state.
- Oh, fun.

466
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,776
We're getting to know Kurt.

467
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:19,363
Ooh, hey, sorry, the door was unlocked,

468
00:16:19,398 --> 00:16:20,598
so I opened it. Is Kate here?

469
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:22,166
Oh, hey.

470
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:23,757
I think I left my wallet
in your couch bed.

471
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:25,026
Uh, have you seen it?

472
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:26,702
- It's silver.
- Babe, who is this?

473
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:27,865
- Babe?
- That's William.

474
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:29,768
He is a human statue I know.

475
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:31,037
Yeah, it's not really a
good time right now, William.

476
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,373
We don't have your wallet. Bye.

477
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,876
Did you have sex with this silver man?

478
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,813
- Did you cheat on me?
- We were broken up.

479
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:39,282
And you cheated on me like
ten times when we were dating.

480
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:40,918
'Cause you were sad all the time.

481
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:42,920
- 'Cause my mom died.
- Oh, no.

482
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:44,421
- In March.
- That's so recent.

483
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:46,357
Fine. I'm sorry, Kurt. I'm sorry.

484
00:16:46,392 --> 00:16:48,292
What? No, don't apologize to this guy.

485
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:50,194
- He's a dick.
- Excuse me?

486
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:51,562
You're not good enough for my sister.

487
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:53,364
I didn't realize you were this tall.

488
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,399
Kurt. She's not going anywhere with you.

489
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,534
Take your jean shorts
and the butt that's in them

490
00:16:57,569 --> 00:16:59,269
and get out of my apartment.

491
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:01,038
What the hell, man? You're
the one who flew me out here

492
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:02,840
and begged me to bring her
back to Dallas.

493
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,207
- Just...
- Kate!

494
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:06,526
Tsk.

495
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:08,692
You begged him to get rid of me?

496
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,961
Uh...

497
00:17:10,249 --> 00:17:11,974
Hey!

498
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:14,729
Found my wallet.

499
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:29,104
Thanks, guys.

500
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:31,138
Have a blessed day.

501
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:38,343
So he was a robot man.

502
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,716
So you were trying to get rid of me?

503
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:45,447
I mean... Yeah, kinda.

504
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,409
But I also just told off Kurt
for being a jerk to you,

505
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:49,145
so who's to say which thing
we should focus on?

506
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:50,955
Anyways, let's go to Olive
Garden and get tanked.

507
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,424
No, I won't, because
that place is for family.

508
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:54,458
Ah, that stings.

509
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:56,105
Look, we're still family.

510
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,560
I just didn't think you
should be moving to New York.

511
00:17:57,596 --> 00:17:58,967
The whole plan seemed a little...

512
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:00,682
how do I put this delicately...

513
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:01,698
psychotic.

514
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:03,701
I didn't ask you to be a part
of my life, Jake.

515
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:04,822
You asked me.

516
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:06,636
I was perfectly happy in Dallas

517
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:09,273
with no dad and a dead mom,

518
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:11,068
being walked all over
by Kurt and his kids.

519
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:12,643
That doesn't sound like
a great situation.

520
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:14,378
Yeah, it's bad, okay?!

521
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:16,580
Which is why when I got
a call out of the blue

522
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:18,449
that I had a brother who
wanted to meet me,

523
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:20,317
I got a little excited. I'm so sorry.

524
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:22,686
I was excited too, but we
don't know each other.

525
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,288
You shouldn't move here just for me.

526
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:25,723
Don't worry. I'm going back to Dallas.

527
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:27,493
You won't ever have to see me again.

528
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:29,960
Until, that is, I'm on "The Voice,"

529
00:18:29,995 --> 00:18:34,965
at point, you'll see me...
♪ Everywhere! ♪

00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:39,936
Well, good, because that

533
00:18:49,982 --> 00:18:51,649
She's gonna do bad on "The Voice."

534
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,385
So, how'd it go last night?

535
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,388
- Worst date I've ever been on.
- Oh, no, that sucks.

536
00:18:57,423 --> 00:18:59,390
Then why are you coming in
to work so late?

537
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:02,126
It's almost like you
spent the night somewhere.

538
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:04,495
I don't know, like,
maybe the bartender's?

539
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,869
Wait, what? How do you know that?

540
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:07,939
Because Aubrey is my friend,

541
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:10,183
and she was the real set-up all along.

542
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,052
No, no, no, no, no.

543
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:14,627
Yes, I knew you'd reject
whoever I put in front of you.

544
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,707
I mean, Trishelle was just a decoy.

545
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:21,245
And you fell for it hook, line,
and skinny margarita.

546
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,147
Nicely done. Aubrey is great.

547
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:24,415
We're going to dinner again tonight.

548
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,083
- Whoo!
- I owe you an apology.

549
00:19:26,118 --> 00:19:27,318
You're a great matchmaker.

550
00:19:27,353 --> 00:19:28,652
Thank you. And you know what?

551
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:30,694
I'm just glad that you found the courage

552
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:32,523
to tell me how great I am.

553
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:33,669
It means so much.

554
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,473
- Whatever.
- Have a fun night.

555
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:37,983
This is not on us.

556
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,597
I mean, it was crazy for her
to think moving to New York

557
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:40,664
was a good idea, right?

558
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:42,500
Yes, it was unrealistic.

559
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:45,069
Just like Mongkut thinking
a ten-year-old American girl

560
00:19:45,104 --> 00:19:48,023
would pay his bail and help him
seek vengeance on his brother.

561
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,264
You know, when I'm not
distracted by this,

562
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,029
I'd really love to hear
the full Mongkut story.

563
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,331
- It gets dark.
- Yup.

564
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:54,788
Look, your sister is a lot to take.

565
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:56,180
You shouldn't feel bad

566
00:19:56,215 --> 00:19:57,615
that you don't want
her around constantly.

567
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,083
Right? I mean, we can
have a relationship

568
00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:00,751
and still live in separate cities.

569
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:02,180
I'd love to see her, like,

570
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:05,113
once a year for an afternoon, or...

571
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:07,591
- Oh, crap.
- What?

572
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:09,593
Oh, something just dawned on you.

573
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:11,160
Yeah, I got to go to the airport.

574
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:16,700
This is ridiculous.
Listen, the choice is yours.

575
00:20:16,735 --> 00:20:19,436
Lawsuit, or upgrade me
to business class.

576
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,472
- Ball's in your court, pal!
- Hey!

577
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:23,607
Kate, officers, what's going on here?

578
00:20:23,642 --> 00:20:25,576
This woman said she cut her
hand on a ticketing kiosk,

579
00:20:25,611 --> 00:20:27,678
but somebody saw her pull out
a bag of glass.

580
00:20:27,713 --> 00:20:29,680
That's my healing glass, and legally,

581
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:32,016
you can't ask about it.
What kind of airport is this?

582
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:33,953
Okay, I'm with the NYPD.
I got it from here.

583
00:20:34,153 --> 00:20:35,632
Thanks, guys.

584
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:37,755
- What do you want?
- To apologize.

585
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,690
Look, I was trying to get rid of you.

586
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:42,293
Because you're a little bit
of a mess, kinda like dad.

587
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:45,029
- Oh, I'm definitely a mess.
- But I was being like dad too.

588
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:46,463
I was trying to have
a relationship with you,

589
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:48,165
completely on my own terms.

590
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,000
And we both know from
personal experience,

591
00:20:50,035 --> 00:20:51,969
that's a really crappy way
to treat a family member.

592
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:53,404
It is.

593
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:55,172
Thank you for saying that, Jake.

594
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:58,542
And yes, I accept your
invitation to move in with you.

595
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:01,111
- Oh. Um...
- I'm joking.

596
00:21:01,146 --> 00:21:03,380
I'm going back to Dallas. Don't worry.

597
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:05,819
But maybe we can keep in touch.

598
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:07,704
I would really like that.

599
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:10,174
Man, I was worried you were
never gonna want to see me again.

600
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,790
Are you kidding? The way you
stood up for me with Kurt,

601
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:14,841
you're a great big brother.

602
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:18,268
And I have so many other enemies.

603
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:20,264
- You're gonna be real busy.
- Oh.

604
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,919
Anyway, I should go. My plane's leaving.
Come here.

605
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,746
- Noice.
- Toit.

606
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:31,041
All right, sis, have a safe flight.

607
00:21:31,076 --> 00:21:34,111
- No vaping.
